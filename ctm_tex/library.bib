abstract = {High-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems are increasingly incorporated into today's AC power grids, necessitating optimal power flow (OPF) tools for the analysis, planning, and operation of such hybrid systems. To this end, we introduce hynet, a Python-based open-source OPF framework for hybrid AC/DC grids with point-to-point and radial multi-terminal HVDC systems. hynet's software design promotes ease of use, extensibility, and a manifold of solving options, which range from interior-point methods to relaxation-based solution techniques. This paper introduces the underlying mathematical framework, including the system model and OPF formulation. To support large-scale hybrid grids, the presented model balances modeling depth and complexity to offer both adequate accuracy and computational tractability. Additionally, the OPF formulation is simplified by a proposed state space relaxation that unifies the representation of AC and DC subgrids. Furthermore, two supported convex relaxations of the OPF problem and some related results are discussed and generalized. Finally, hynet's software design is illustrated and related to the presented mathematical framework, while highlighting its amenability to extensions.},

abstract = {Linear optimal power flow (LOPF) algorithms use a linearization of the alternating current (AC) load flow equations to optimize generator dispatch in a network subject to the loading constraints of the network branches. Common algorithms use the voltage angles at the buses as optimization variables, but alternatives can be computationally advantageous. In this article we provide a review of existing methods and describe new formulations, which express the loading constraints directly in terms of the flows themselves, using a decomposition of the graph into a spanning tree and closed cycles. We provide a comprehensive study of the computational performance of the various formulations, showing that one of the new formulations of the LOPF solves up to 20 times faster than the angle formulation using commercial linear programming solvers, with an average speed-up of factor 3 for the standard networks considered here. The speed-up is largest for networks with many nodes and decentral generators throughout the network, which is highly relevant given the rise of distributed renewable generation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the global convergence of a large class of primaldual interior point algorithms for solving the linearly constrained convex programming problem. The algorithms in this class decrease the value of a primaldual potential function and hence belong to the class of so-called potential reduction algorithms. An inexact line search based on Armijo stepsize rule is used to compute the stepsize. The directions used by the algorithms are the same as the ones used in primaldual path following and potential reduction algorithms and a very mild condition on the choice of the centering parameter is assumed. The algorithms always keep primal and dual feasibility and, in contrast to the polynomial potential reduction algorithms, they do not need to drive the value of the potential function towards 8 in order to converge. One of the techniques used in the convergence analysis of these algorithms has its root in nonlinear unconstrained optimization theory.},

@article{Warrington2015,
abstract = {We present a rolling decision-making process for electrical power systems, in which unit commitment, dispatch and reserve policies are co-optimized in order to minimize expected short-run operating costs in the presence of uncertainty arising from demand and renewable infeeds. The uncertainty is assumed to be bounded, with estimated first and second moment statistics available. The rolling “look-ahead” process employs a planning horizon of several hours, with re-optimization taking place each time the first step has been implemented. We present an expected-cost formulation incorporating multi-stage recourse on continuous decision variables—plans for adjusting the dispatch in the light of future information to be discovered at each stage of the optimization horizon. The generic formulation allows the flexibility of devices such as energy storage units to be exploited in the reserve mechanism. We demonstrate using closed-loop numerical tests that significant reductions in the cost of accommodating uncertainty are attainable relative to a time-decoupled reserve mechanism. In contrast to previous results, we show that a time-coupled cost function is not required for this benefit to be observed. In addition, we show that relaxing binary unit commitment decisions after the first step of the horizon brings significant computational speed-ups, and in some cases also reduce closed-loop system operation costs.},

abstract = {— Given a stochastic net demand process evolving over a transmission-constrained power network, we consider the system operator's problem of minimizing the expected cost of generator dispatch, when it has access to spatially distributed energy storage resources. We show that the expected benefit of storage derived under the optimal dispatch policy is concave and non-decreasing in the vector of energy storage capacities. Thus, the greatest marginal value of storage is derived at small installed capacities. For such capacities, we provide an upper bound on the locational (nodal) marginal value of storage in terms of the variation of the shadow prices of electricity at each node. In addition, we prove that this upper bound is tight, when the cost of generation is spatially uniform and the network topology is acyclic. These formulae not only shed light on the correct measure of statistical variation in quantifying the value of storage, but also provide computationally tractable tools to empirically calculate the locational marginal value of storage from net demand time series data.},

abstract = {Australia has seen a strong uptake of residential PV systems over the last five years, with small scale distributed generation systems now accounting for around 10{\%} of peak capacity within the Australian National Electricity Market. As uptake further increases, there is concern about the ability of distribution networks to maintain reliability and power quality without requiring substantial additional infrastructure investment, and in some locations PV installations are no longer being allowed. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of real and reactive power control of distributed PV inverter systems, to maintain and improve network power quality. High resolution PV output data has been collected at a number of trial sites in Newcastle, Australia and network impact simulations undertaken for an example long rural feeder gathered from the Australian National Feeder Taxonomy Study. These show how localised PV inverter controls can regulate distribution network voltages, reduce network losses, increase the network hosting capacity and hence the uptake of distributed renewable energy.},

abstract = {This is a book about complex variables that gives the reader a quick and accessible introduction to the key topics. While the coverage is not comprehensive, it certainly gives the reader a solid grounding in this fundamental area. There are many figures and examples to illustrate the principal ideas, and the exposition is lively and inviting. An undergraduate wanting to have a first look at this subject or a graduate student preparing for the qualifying exams, will find this book to be a useful resource. In addition to important ideas from the Cauchy theory, the book also includes the Riemann mapping theorem, harmonic functions, the argument principle, general conformal mapping and dozens of other central topics. Readers will find this book to be a useful companion to more exhaustive texts in the field. It is a valuable resource for mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike.},

abstract = {Purpose: This is a pilot study evaluating the effect of the algorithms and production processes of four commercial manufacturers of stereolithographically produced surgical guide. Materials and Methods: A singular Dicom file was used to produce six distinct duplicate dentures, which function as the base for surgical guides. The duplicate dentures were repeatedly fitted (n=10) into an impression of the occlusal surface of the original scan appliance. The gaps between the incisal edge of teeth {\#}8 and {\#}9 and the corresponding imprints in the vinyl polysiloxane impression were photographed, digitally recorded, and measured in a blinded fashion. Results: Nobel Biocare mean was 0.56mm (range 0.49-0.65), I-dent mean was 0.57mm (range 0.31-0.74), Materialise II mean was 1.12mm (range 0.90-1.40), Blue Sky Bio II mean was 1.13mm (range 0.93-1.35), Materialise I mean was 1.43mm (range 1.21-1.86), and Blue Sky Bio I mean was 2.17mm (range 2.06-2.34). The difference between the fit of the Nobel Biocare and the I-dent guide bases and the guide bases from Materialise and Blue Sky Bio is statistically significant (p{\textless}.05). Conclusion: The algorithms and production processes of the different manufactures do influence the congruency outcome of the produced surgical guide bases. Within the limits of this study, we were unable to produce a perfect fit, although some duplicate dentures showed minimal errors. The implications of the discrepancies need further study. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The connection of single-phase DG units to three-phase distribution networks will not only alter the voltage profile in the connected phase, but also the two other phase voltages will be influenced due to neutral-point shifting and voltage unbalance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of single-phase DG units on the phase voltages, in different circumstances. This will be investigated by performing several simulations. In order to make these detailed simulations, an unbalanced multiphase harmonic power flow method, considering the neutral wire, will be proposed. The presented model uses the iterative forward/backward method. Furthermore, the network is solved by using symmetrical components and the prevalent convergence problems will be tackled in this paper.},

Based on a rolling load forecasting method, along with the peak load reduction requirements in reality, at the planning level, we propose a BESS capacity planning model for peak and load shaving problem. At the operational level, we consider the optimal control policy towards charging and discharging power with two different optimization objectives: one is to diminish the difference between the peak load and the valley load, the other is to minimize the daily load variance. Particularly, the constraint of charging and discharging cycles, which is an important issue in practice, is taken into consideration. Finally, based on real load data, we provide simulation results that validate the proposed optimization models and control strategies.},

This paper presents examples of local optima on a variety of test networks including modified versions of common networks. We show that local optima can occur because the feasible region is disconnected and/or because of nonlinearities in the constraints. Standard local optimization techniques are shown to converge to these local optima. The voltage bounds of all the examples in this paper are between ±5{\%} and ±10{\%} off-nominal. The examples with local optima are available in an online archive (http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/optenergy/LocalOpt/) and can be used to test local or global optimization techniques for OPF. Finally we use our test examples to illustrate the behavior of a recent semi-definite programming approach that aims to find the global solution of OPF.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The problems of wave propagation and power flow in the distribution network composed of an overhead wire parallel to the surface of the ground have not been satisfactorily solved. While a complete solution of the actual problem is impossible, as it is explained in the famous Carson's paper (1926), the solution of the problem, where the actual earth is replaced by a plane homogenous semi-infinite solid, is of considerable interest. In this paper, a power flow algorithm in distribution networks with earth return, based on backward-forward technique, is discussed. In this novel use of the technique, the ground is explicitly represented. In addition, an iterative method for determining impedance for modelling ground effect in the extended power flow algorithm is suggested. Results obtained from single-wire and three-wire studies using IEEE test networks are presented and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ali2017,
abstract = {Due to their generality, conic optimization problems, which can represent most convex optimization problems encountered in practice, have been the focus of much recent work, and additionally form the basis of many convex optimization modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce Newton-ADMM, a method for fast conic optimization. The basic idea is to view the residuals of consecutive iterates generated by SCS, a state-of-the-art, iterative conic solver, as a fixed point iteration, and then use a nonsmooth Newton method to find a fixed point. We demonstrate theoretically, by extending the theory of semismooth operators, that Newton-ADMM converges rapidly (i.e., quadratically) to a solution; empirically, Newton-ADMM is significantly faster than SCS, on a number of problems. The method also has essentially no tuning parameters, generates certificates of primal or dual infeasibility, when appropriate, and can be specialized to solve specific convex problems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method to optimally set the tap position of voltage regulation transformers in distribution systems. We cast the problem as a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP), in which the transformer tap ratios are captured by 1) introducing a secondary-side �virtual� bus per transformer, and 2) constraining the values that these virtual bus voltages can take according to the limits on the tap positions. Then, by relaxing the non-convex rank-1 constraint in the rank-constrained SDP formulation, one obtains a convex SDP problem. The tap positions are determined as the ratio between the primary-side bus voltage and the secondary-side virtual bus voltage that result from the optimal solution of the relaxed SDP, and then rounded to the nearest discrete tap values. To efficiently solve the relaxed SDP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We present several case studies with single- and three-phase distribution systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed ADMM-based algorithm, and compare its results with centralized solution methods.},

abstract = {This paper develops a branch-flow based optimal power flow (OPF) problem for multi-phase distribution networks that allows for tap selection of wye, closed-delta, and open-delta step-voltage regulators (SVRs). SVRs are assumed ideal and their taps are represented by continuous decision variables. To tackle the non-linearity, the branch-flow semidefinite programming framework of traditional OPF is expanded to accommodate SVR edges. Three types of non-convexity are addressed: (a) rank-1 constraints on non-SVR edges, (b) nonlinear equality constraints on SVR power flows and taps, and (c) trilinear equalities on SVR voltages and taps. Leveraging a practical phase-separation assumption on the SVR secondary voltage, novel McCormick relaxations are provided for (c) and certain rank-1 constraints of (a), while dropping the rest. A linear relaxation based on conservation of power is used in place of (b). Numerical simulations on standard distribution test feeders corroborate the merits of the proposed convex formulation.},

The new variables allow to set out a simpler mathematical optimization problem where, additionally, the product of continuous and binary variable does not appear, so one of the main problems related to the mathematical reconfiguration problem is avoided. The final minimization problem is made up of linear and quadratic equality and inequality constraints, also being linear the objective function.

In all the cases the reached solution matches the better known and even in same cases it has been improved. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Themodel incorporates the natural gas transportation planning objective in the co-optimization planning of power generation and transmission systems. The co-optimiza- tion planning model is decomposed into a least-costmaster invest- ment problem for natural gas and electricity systems which inter- acts with two operation subproblems representing the feasibility (security) and the optimality (economic) of the proposed co-opti- mization. In addition, the natural gas subproblemwould check the feasibility of fuel supply transportation system as part of the pro- posed co-optimization planning. The co-optimization planning of electricity and natural gas infrastructureswould satisfy the desired power system reliability criterion. The iterative process will con- tinue between the co-optimization investment and the operation subproblems until an economic, secure, reliable, and fuel-supply feasible planning for the two interdependent infrastructures is ob- tained. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization planning approach. Index},

abstract = {E-bikes in China are the single largest adoption of alternative fuel vehicles in history, with more than 100 million e-bikes purchased in the past decade and vehicle ownership about 2× larger for e-bikes as for conventional cars; e-car sales, too, are rapidly growing. We compare emissions (CO(2), PM(2.5), NO(X), HC) and environmental health impacts (primary PM(2.5)) from the use of conventional vehicles (CVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) in 34 major cities in China. CO(2) emissions (g km(-1)) vary and are an order of magnitude greater for e-cars (135-274) and CVs (150-180) than for e-bikes (14-27). PM(2.5) emission factors generally are lower for CVs (gasoline or diesel) than comparable EVs. However, intake fraction is often greater for CVs than for EVs because combustion emissions are generally closer to population centers for CVs (tailpipe emissions) than for EVs (power plant emissions). For most cities, the net result is that primary PM(2.5) environmental health impacts per passenger-km are greater for e-cars than for gasoline cars (3.6× on average), lower than for diesel cars (2.5× on average), and equal to diesel buses. In contrast, e-bikes yield lower environmental health impacts per passenger-km than the three CVs investigated: gasoline cars (2×), diesel cars (10×), and diesel buses (5×). Our findings highlight the importance of considering exposures, and especially the proximity of emissions to people, when evaluating environmental health impacts for EVs.},

abstract = {The emerging distribution system with a proliferation of distributed energy resources (DER) and flexible demand assets is expected to experience a restructuring process, just as what has been happening in the transmission system. This paper introduces the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) as an effectively economic signal to quantify marginal cost for supplying next incremental loads at different phases of individual nodes. DLMP is calculated by solving the unbalanced AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem of distribution systems, with the objective of minimizing system operation cost. Indeed, in order to derive effective DLMPs, global optimal solution to the non-convex unbalanced ACOPF problem with a zero duality gap needs to be obtained. This paper solves the unbalanced ACOPF problem via the moment relaxation based semidefinite programming (SDP) model. System sparsity is explored to accelerate the computational performance. In addition, a hierarchical approach is proposed to recover a good enough feasible solution to the original ACOPF, when the sparse moment relaxation based SDP model is inexact. Numerical case studies on a modified IEEE 34-bus system evaluate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach. DLMP based revenue adequacy of the distribution system is also analyzed.},

abstract = {The fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Op-timization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning re-searchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical pro-gramming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed im-provements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general pur-pose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.},

In this paper, we reformulate QPs as a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP). This is done via the reformulation of QP as a linear complementary problem, and the use of binary variables together with some fundamental results on the solution of perturbed linear systems, to model the complementary constraints. Reformulating non-convex QPs as MILPs provides an advantageous way to obtain global solutions as it allows to use current state-of-the-art MILP solvers. To illustrate, we compare the performance of our solution approach with the current benchmark global QP solver quadprogBB on a large variety of QP test instances. The MATLAB code, called quadprogIP, and the instances used to perform these numerical experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/xiawei918/quadprogIP.},

abstract = {—High penetration of renewable energy sources and the increasing share of stochastic loads require the explicit repre-sentation of uncertainty in tools such as the optimal power flow (OPF). Current approaches follow either a linearized approach or an iterative approximation of non-linearities. This paper proposes a convex reformulation of a chance-constrained AC-OPF. Using an affine policy, we can ensure tractability, accurately model large power deviations, and determine suitable control policies for active power, reactive power, and voltage. We consider two types of uncertainty sets. For a rectangular uncertainty set it is sufficient to enforce the chance constraints at its vertices. For a multivariate Gaussian distribution of forecast errors, we propose a novel analytical reformulation of the linear chance constraints and a tractable approximation of the semi-definite chance constraints. We demonstrate the performance of our methods on an IEEE 9 bus system with two wind farms. Our approach satisfies all AC power flow constraints, and is exact, achieving zero relaxation gap.},

abstract = {In static voltage stability analysis, participation factors have been used as an index that measures the contribution of the critical mode of power flow Jacobian in the system states. However, this index as usually defined is in a mode-in-state manner that cannot adequately reflect the impact of system states on voltage collapse. In this paper we take a new state-in-mode viewpoint to study the power flow Jacobian. We express the critical mode into a weighted sum of system states, which gives rise to the definitions of state-in-mode participation factor (SIMPF) and state-in-mode sensitivity (SIMS). The SIMPF measures the contribution of a system state to the critical mode, and the SIMS measures the control sensitivity of the system state to the critical mode. The proposed SIMPF and SIMS apply to both node states and network states including active/reactive power injections and active power flows across lines. They provide new insights into the mechanism of saddle-node bifurcation and limit-induced bifurcation, two most common types of voltage instability, by revealing the role of system states. The SIMPF and SIMS can also guide the system dispatch for voltage stability enhancement. The obtained results are validated by the simulations on IEEE 118-bus system and Polish 3120-bus system.},

abstract = {(This is the main PhD thesis of Julia). Array-based programming environments are popular for scientific and technical computing. These systems consist of built-in function libraries paired with high-level languages for interaction. Although the libraries perform well, it is widely believed that scripting in these languages is necessarily slow, and that only heroic feats of engineering can at best partially ameliorate this problem. This thesis argues that what is really needed is a more coherent structure for this functionality. To find one, we must ask what technical computing is really about. This thesis suggests that this kind of programming is characterized by an emphasis on operator complexity and code specialization, and that a language can be designed to better fit these requirements. The key idea is to integrate code selection with code specialization, using generic functions and data-flow type inference. Systems like these can suffer from inefficient compilation, or from uncertainty about what to specialize on. We show that sufficiently powerful type-based dispatch addresses these problems. The resulting language, Julia, achieves a Quine-style “explication by elimination” of many of the productive features technical computing users expect.},

We use the logarithm of the determinant as a smooth approximation for rank, and locally minimize this function to obtain a sequence of trace minimization problems. We then present a lemma that relates the rank of any general matrix to that of a corresponding positive semidefinite one. Using this, we readily extend the proposed heuristic to handle general matrices. We examine the vector case as a special case, where the heuristic reduces to an iterative l1-norm minimization technique. As practical applications of the rank minimization problem and our heuristic, we consider two examples: minimum-order system realization with time-domain constraints, and finding lowest-dimension embedding of points in a Euclidean space from noisy distance data.},

abstract = {Balanced three-phase four-wire distribution grids can host significantly more distributed generation and electric vehicles. Three-phase photovoltaic (PV) inverters and electric vehicle (EV) chargers can be adapted to transfer power from highly loaded to less loaded phases, without overloading the inverter or charger. Grid conditions will be improved due to a more balanced operation of the network and more PV panels and EVs can be connected before the limits of the network are reached. A classic coordinated charging strategy for EVs is adapted in this paper. It is shown that the charging of EVs can be improved when power can be transferred from one phase to another. Using PV inverters with a balancing inverter, the power injected in each phase will become a controllable variable as the total amount of produced power does not necessarily need to be equally divided across the three phases. The improvements made by using EV chargers and PV inverters that can balance the network are investigated. Several load flow simulations with realistic data show a positive effect on the system losses, the grid voltage, and voltage unbalance. Finally, a local controller is proposed to control the balancing between the phases when a real-time communication channel is not available.},

Recently the visualization community has risen to the challenge of incorporating an indication of uncertainty into visual representations, and in this article we review their work. We place the work in the context of a reference model for data visualization, that sees data pass through a pipeline of processes. This allows us to distinguish the visualization of uncertainty—which considers how we depict uncertainty specified with the data—and the uncertainty of visualization—which considers how much inaccuracy occurs as we process data through the pipeline. It has taken some time for uncertain visualization methods to be developed, and we explore why uncertainty visualization is hard—one explanation is that we typically need to find another display dimension and we may have used these up already! To organize the material we return to a typology developed by one of us in the early days of visualization, and make use of this to present a catalog of visualization techniques describing the research that has been done to extend each method to handle uncertainty. Finally we note the responsibility on us all to incorporate any known uncertainty into a visualization, so that integrity of the discipline is maintained.},

@article{Zlotnik2017,
abstract = {The extensive installation of gas-fired power plants in many parts of the world has led electric systems to depend heavily on reliable gas supplies. The use of gas-fired generators for peak load and reserve provision causes high intra-day variability in withdrawals from high pressure gas transmission systems. Such variability can lead to gas price fluctuations and supply disruptions that affect electric generator dispatch, electricity prices, and threaten the security of power systems and gas pipelines. These infrastructures function on vastly different spatiotemporal scales, which prevents current practices for separate operations and market clearing from being coordinated. In this paper, we apply new techniques for control of dynamic gas flows on pipeline networks to examine day-ahead scheduling of electric generator dispatch and gas compressor operation for different levels of integration, spanning from separate forecasting and simulation to combined optimal control. We formulate multiple coordination scenarios and develop tractable, physically accurate computational implementations. These scenarios are compared using an integrated model of test networks for power and gas systems with 24 nodes and 24 pipes, respectively, which are coupled through gas-fired generators. The analysis quantifies the economic efficiency and security benefits of gas-electric coordination and dynamic gas system operation.},

We model a multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) problem with charge and discharge dynamics for energy storage collocated with load and/or generation. We then apply a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) and derive the storage subproblem from the Lagrangian dual. We use the storage subproblem to investigate the relationship between the storage variables and the locational marginal prices (LMPs), which are market-based price signals defined by the dual variables associated with the nodal active power flow balance. Our theoretical results prove that LMPs drive charging and discharging dynamics, and that storage is allocated and operated to maximize the storage operator's profits, i.e. minimize the system costs in a purely competitive market. We then use this framework to illustrate LMP-based storage dynamics.},

Here we analyse the authors' methodology and find it problematic. The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low economic cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, which the authors have evaluated positively elsewhere, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and decreasing in cost every year.},

abstract = {AC optimal power flow (AC{\~{}}OPF) is a challenging non-convex optimization problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control. Recently developed convex relaxation techniques provide new insights regarding the global optimality of AC{\~{}}OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow equations. This paper proposes two methods for tightening the QC relaxation. The first method introduces new variables that represent the voltage magnitude differences between connected buses. Using "bound tightening" techniques, the bounds on the voltage magnitude difference variables can be significantly smaller than the bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves, so constraints based on voltage magnitude differences can tighten the relaxation. Second, rather than a potentially weaker "nested McCormick" formulation, this paper applies "Meyer and Floudas" envelopes that yield the convex hull of the trilinear monomials formed by the product of the voltage magnitudes and trignometric terms in the polar form of the power flow equations. Comparison to a state-of-the-art QC implementation demonstrates the advantages of these improvements via smaller optimality gaps.},

It is shown that the line selection task boils down to a shrinkage and thresholding operation on the line currents. Further, numerical tests illustrate the ability of the proposed scheme to identify meshed, weakly meshed, or even radial configurations by adjusting a sparsity-tuning parameter in the DSR cost. Constraints on the voltages are investigated and incorporated in the novel DSR problem to facilitate voltage regulation.},

However, no specific model exists to examine the costs of manufacturing these cylindrical cells. Here we present a process-based cost model tailored to the cylindrical lithium-ion cells currently used in the EV market. We examine the costs for varied cell dimensions, electrode thicknesses, chemistries, and production volumes. Although cost savings are possible from increasing cell dimensions and electrode thicknesses, economies of scale have already been reached, and future cost reductions from increased production volumes are minimal. Prismatic cells, which are able to further capitalize on the cost reduction from larger formats, can offer further reductions than those possible for cylindrical cells.},

abstract = {Expansion of natural gas networks is a critical process involving substantial capital expenditures with complex decision-support requirements. Given the non-convex nature of gas transmission constraints, global optimality and infeasibility guarantees can only be offered by global optimisation approaches. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art global optimisation solvers are unable to scale up to real-world size instances. In this study, we present a convex mixed-integer second-order cone relaxation for the gas expansion planning problem under steady-state conditions. The underlying model offers tight lower bounds with high computational efficiency. In addition, the optimal solution of the relaxation can often be used to derive high-quality solutions to the original problem, leading to provably tight optimality gaps and, in some cases, global optimal soluutions. The convex relaxation is based on a few key ideas, including the introduction of flux direction variables, exact McCormick relaxations, on/off constraints, and integer cuts. Numerical experiments are conducted on the traditional Belgian gas network, as well as other real larger networks. The results demonstrate both the accuracy and computational speed of the relaxation and its ability to produce high-quality solutions.},

abstract = {The inertia of today's power system decreases as more and more converter connected generation units and load are integrated in the power system. This results in a power system which behaves differently from before which causes concerns for many grid operators. Therefore, a detailed study is needed to investigate the relevance of this inertia in the operation, control and stability of the system. Moreover, a new definition of the term system inertia is necessary since is it expected that in the future also the renewable electricity generation units will deliver the so-called virtual (synthetic) inertia. In this paper a review of the research related to inertia in a power system is given. Both the challenges as the solutions from an operator point of view to control a system with low inertia are discussed. Also a new definition of inertia is proposed to incorporate the different forms of inertia which are each described in more detail. From recent studies, it can be concluded that the influence of reduced inertia on frequency stability is generally considered as the main challenge for system operators, but with the additional measures listed in this paper, this impact can be mitigated.},

abstract = {Rising electricity prices, concerns regarding system security, and emissions reduction are central to an energy policy debate under way in Australia. To better evaluate mechanisms that seek to address the nexus of engineering, economic, and environmental challenges facing the country's electricity system, we have constructed network and generator datasets describing the operation of Australia's largest transmission network. These data have been collated using open-source software, and are available under an open license. They include the geospatial locations of network elements, and have been designed to interface with a public database maintained by the Australian Energy Market Operator. This interface allows historic data, such as generator dispatch and regional load signals, to be integrated with market models. Interactive network maps, independent datasets, and power-flow models have been used to assess the completeness and functionality of the derived datasets. In the context of Australia, these data can be used to examine geospatial and temporal impacts of power injections from renewables. More generally, they allow market models to be benchmarked against realised outcomes.},

The PJM Interconnection energy market is one of the largest centralized markets in the world. Recently PJM deployed a newly developed application called “Perfect Dispatch” designed to provide a baseline measure of grid operational performance using retroactive real time market simulation and analysis. In the first nine months of 2009 over {\$}100 million in production cost saving have been attributed to its use. This paper provides an overview of the Perfect Dispatch implementation at PJM and discusses applications and benefits of the “Perfect Dispatch”.},

@article{Madani2016,
abstract = {Consider an arbitrary power network with PV and PQ buses, where active powers and voltage magnitudes are known at PV buses, and active and reactive powers are known at PQ buses. The classical power flow (PF) problem aims to find the unknown complex voltages at all buses. This problem is usually solved approximately through linearization or in an asymptotic sense using Newton's method, given that the solution belongs to a good regime containing voltage vectors with small angles. The question arises as to whether the PF problem can be cast as the solution of a convex optimization problem over that regime. The objective of this paper is to show that the answer to the above question is affirmative. More precisely, we propose a class of convex optimization problems with the property that they all solve the PF problem as long as angles are small. Each convex problem proposed in this work is in the form of a semidefinite program(SDP). Associated with each SDP, we explicitly characterize the set of complex voltages that can be recovered via that convex problem. Since there are infinitely many SDP problems, each capable of recovering a potentially different set of voltages, designing a good SDP problem is cast as a convex problem.},

abstract = {The usual formulation of quantum theory is based on rather obscure axioms (employing complex Hilbert spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for calculating probabilities). In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory. Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or even just the word "continuous" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from. We also gain insight into the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory.},

abstract = {This paper develops a branch-flow based optimal power flow (OPF) problem for multi-phase distribution networks that allows for tap selection of wye, closed-delta, and open-delta step-voltage regulators (SVRs). SVRs are assumed ideal and their taps are represented by continuous decision variables. To tackle the non-linearity, the branch-flow semidefinite programming framework of traditional OPF is expanded to accommodate SVR edges. Three types of non-convexity are addressed: (a) rank-1 constraints on non-SVR edges, (b) nonlinear equality constraints on SVR power flows and taps, and (c) trilinear equalities on SVR voltages and taps. Leveraging a practical phase-separation assumption on the SVR secondary voltage, novel McCormick relaxations are provided for (c) and certain rank-1 constraints of (a), while dropping the rest. A linear relaxation based on conservation of power is used in place of (b). Numerical simulations on standard distribution test feeders corroborate the merits of the proposed convex formulation.},

The FCC-OPF is presented in previous work, but here its application is extended. In this paper, we analyze a concise method for the identification of infeasible RAs, filtering of inadequate RAs for the reduction of fault currents below FCCs and ranking of RAs according to economy. The algorithm was tested on a medium-scale network and the results demonstrate efficiency for the suggested approach.},

abstract = {Energy storage has been proven to yield positive effects on planning, operation and control of electric grids. It has become a crucial task to properly model the energy storage systems (ESS) under the framework of grid optimization on transmission and distribution networks including microgrids. This paper presents a review on mathematical models and test cases of ESSs used for grid optimization studies, where the network constraints of power systems are included. The existing ESS models are mainly classified into two categories; linear and nonlinear models. The two main categories are further divided into several subcategories respectively; such as mixed integer linear and convex nonlinear subcategories. Based on the review and discussions, this paper aims at providing suggestions for choosing proper ESS models for specific grid optimization studies considering the chosen power network model.},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of distributed generations (DGs) and variable loads introduces significant power fluctuations to distribution networks, rendering conventional reconfiguration strategies ineffective. In the context of an active distribution network (ADN), remote control switches can be operated in real time through a centralized control scheme. Therein the distribution network topology can be configured in a flexible and dynamic manner capable of adapting to time-varying load demand and DG output. This paper presents a dynamic reconfiguration approach for a three-phase unbalanced distribution network. The ADN topology is optimized for the look-ahead time periods and is adaptive to the time-varying load demand and DG output while minimizing the daily power loss costs. To improve the calculation efficiency, several linearization methods are introduced to formulate the dynamic reconfiguration as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, which can be effectively solved using off-the-shelf solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the test results obtained on a modified IEEE 34 node test feeder.},

abstract = {It is well known that selecting a good Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation is crucial for an effective solution with state-of-the art solvers. While best practices and guidelines for constructing good formulations abound, there is rarely a systematic construction leading to the best possible formulation. We introduce embedding formulations and complexity as a new MIP formulation paradigm for systematically constructing formulations for disjunctive constraints that are optimal with respect to size. More specifically, they yield the smallest possible ideal formulation (i.e. one whose LP relaxation has integral extreme points) among all formulations that only use 0-1 auxiliary variables. We use the paradigm to characterize optimal formulations for SOS2 constraints and certain piecewise linear functions of two variables. We also show that the resulting formulations can provide a significant computational advantage over all known formulations for piecewise linear functions (up to 70 times speed improvement for the harder instances).},

However, examining the constituent materials of these devices shows that lithium is a relatively small contributor to both the battery mass and manufacturing cost. The use of more expensive lithium precursor materials results in less than 1{\%} increases in the cost of lithium ion cells considered. Similarly, larger fluctuations in the global lithium price (from {\$}0 to {\$}25/kg from a baseline of {\$}7.50 per kg of Li2CO3) do not change the cost of lithium ion cells by more than 10{\%}. While this small cost increase will not have a substantial impact on consumers, it could affect the manufacturers of these lithium ion cells, who already operate with small profit margins.},

Robust optimization is very useful for practice, since it is tailored to the information at hand, and it leads to computationally tractable formulations. It is therefore remarkable that real-life applications of robust optimization are still lagging behind; there is much more potential for real-life applications than has been exploited hitherto. The aim of this paper is to help practitioners to understand robust optimization and to successfully apply it in practice. We provide a brief introduction to robust optimization, and also describe important do's and don'ts for using it in practice. We use many small examples to illustrate our discussions.},

abstract = {Increased coupling between critical infrastructure networks, such as power and communication systems, will have important implications for the reliability and security of these systems. To understand the effects of power-communication coupling, several have studied interdependent network models and reported that increased coupling can increase system vulnerability. However, these results come from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading, relative to those found in actual power and communication networks. This paper reports on two sets of experiments that compare the network vulnerability implications resulting from simple topological models and models that more accurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. First, we compare a simple model of topological contagion to a model of cascading in power systems and find that the power grid shows a much higher level of vulnerability, relative to the contagion model. Second, we compare a model of topological cascades in coupled networks to three different physics-based models of power grids coupled to communication networks. Again, the more accurate models suggest very different conclusions. In all but the most extreme case, the physics-based power grid models indicate that increased power-communication coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from what one would conclude from the coupled topological model, in which zero coupling is optimal. Finally, an extreme case in which communication failures immediately cause grid failures, suggests that if systems are poorly designed, increased coupling can be harmful. Together these results suggest design strategies for reducing the risk of cascades in interdependent infrastructure systems.},

This paper focuses on the mod- eling and solution approach of AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) for unbalanced distribution systems with DERs and voltage reg- ulation transformers (VRT). The ACOPF problem is formulated as a chordal relaxation based semidefinite programming (SDP) model, and a tighter convexification model of VRTs is proposed for mitigating solution inexactness. Analytical conditions are pre- sented and proved to determine whether global optimal solution to the original ACOPF problem can be retrieved from solutions of the chordal relaxation based SDP model. Numerical studies on modified IEEE 34-bus and 8500-node systems show that the pro- posed approach presents a better computational performance as compared to rank relaxation based SDP approaches and general nonlinear solvers.},

abstract = {US public policy towards the private electric power industry is moving away from restrictive regulation and towards promotion of competition. Alternative policies concerning access to and pricing of transmission are now being discussed. Similar issues may arise in Europe as trade barriers fall. Our purpose is to show how game theory can help illuminate that debate and identify desirable policies. Game theory models are used to estimate the possible effects of various policies upon productive efficiency and the distribution of gains among sellers, transmitters, and buyers of power. Static cooperative models are used to calculate the possible outcomes of short-run transmission games. Long-run games in which the amount of transmission capacity is a decisition variable are modeled as dynamic noncooperative Stackelberg games. One conclusion is that, under some conditions, price regulation and mandatory access could hurt power buyers by removing incentives for building transmission capacity. Another conclusion is that, under a system of voluntary access and price regulation, it may be better to allow wheeling prices to exceed the marginal cost of transport rather than to risk losing the benefits of cooperation. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {It has been recognized recently that to represent a polyhedron as the projection of a higher dimensional, but simpler, polyhedron, is a powerful tool in polyhedral combinatorics. We develop a general method to construct higher-dimensional polyhedra (or, in some cases, convex sets) whose projection approximates the convex hull of 0-1 valued solutions of a system of linear inequalities. An important feature of these approximations is that one can optimize any linear objective function over them in polynomial time. In the special case of the vertex packing polytope, we obtain a sequence of systems of inequalities, such that already the first system includes clique, odd hole, odd antihole, wheel, and orthogonality constraints. In particular, for perfect (and many other) graphs, this first system gives the vertex packing polytope. For various classes of graphs, including t-perfect graphs, it follows that the stable set polytope is the projection of a polytope with a polynomial number of facets. We also discuss an extension of the method, which establishes a connection with certain submodular functions and the M{\"{o}}bius function of a lattice.},

@article{Bruninx2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Renewable electricity generation not only provides affordable and emission-free electricity but also introduces additional complexity in the day-ahead planning procedure. To address the stochastic nature of renewable generation, system operators must schedule enough controllable generation to have the flexibility required to compensate unavoidable real-time mismatches between the production and consumption of electricity. This flexibility must be scheduled ahead of real-time and comes at a cost, which should be minimized without compromising the operational reliability of the system. Energy storage facilities, such as pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), can respond quickly to mismatches between demand and generation. Hydraulic constraints on the operation of PHES must be taken into account in the day-ahead scheduling problem, which is typically not done in deterministic models. Stochastic optimization enhances the procurement of flexibility, but requires more computational resources than conventional deterministic optimization. This paper proposes a deterministic and an interval unit commitment formulation for the co-optimization of controllable generation and PHES, including a representation of the hydraulic constraints of the PHES. The proposed unit commitment (UC) models are tested against a stochastic UC formulation on a model of the Belgian power system to compare the resulting operational cost, reliability, and computational requirements. The cost-effective regulating capabilities offered by the PHES yield significant operational cost reductions in both models, while the increase in calculation times is limited.},

This paper improves on the effectiveness of energy-aware room-booking and occupancy scheduling approaches, by allowing the scheduling decisions to rely on an explicit model of the building's occupancy-based HVAC control. The core component of our approach is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which optimally solves the joint occupancy scheduling and occupancy-based HVAC control problem. To scale up to realistic problem sizes, we embed this MILP model into a large neighborhood search (LNS). We obtain substantial energy reduction in comparison with occupancy-based HVAC control using arbitrary schedules or using schedules obtained by existing heuristic energy-aware scheduling approaches.},

abstract = {Many of the European energy markets are characterized by dominant players that own a large share of their respective countries' generation capacities. In addition to that, there is a significant lack of cross-border transmission capacity. Combining both facts justifies the assumption that these dominant players are able to influence the market outcome of an internal European energy market due to strategic behavior. In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation in order to solve a Stackelberg game for a network-constrained energy market using integer programming. The strategic player is the Stackelberg leader and the independent system operator (including the decisions of the competitive fringe firms) acts as follower. We assume that there is one strategic player which results in a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). This MPEC is reformulated as mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by using disjunctive constraints and linearization. The MILP formulation gives the opportunity to solve the problems reliably and paves the way to add discrete constraints to the original MPEC formulation which can be used in order to solve discretely-constrained mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (DC-MPECs). We report computational results for a small illustrative network as well as a stylized Western European grid with realistic data. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{West2014,
abstract = {This paper presents the results from two real-world trials of an optimised supervisory model predictive control (MPC) system for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in commercial buildings. The system learns a model from historical data and uses weather forecasts and a given temperature set-point profile to predict building zone conditions and thermal comfort with the aim of optimising building controls for a number of HVAC zones throughout a day. The multi-objective optimisation minimises running cost and CO2emissions, subject to operator preferences, while constraining occupant thermal discomfort to an acceptable range to find the best zone temperature set-point schedule for the building. This schedule is then applied to the building by a feedback control loop, which balances the power supplied to each zone for heating, cooling and ventilation. A complementary online occupant comfort feedback tool was deployed to all occupant computers in the trial office buildings. This tool allows occupants to submit feedback on their thermal comfort and satisfaction at any point in time via electronic surveys, as well as allowing these surveys to be issued to occupants at scheduled times. This feedback fine-tuned the thermal comfort model used to constrain the optimisation, allowing for errors in the comfort model to be compensated. Thermal comfort feedback was also used to measure and compare relative occupant comfort levels with a baseline. This control system was trialled on two office buildings in Australia, over two winter months and results compared with the performance of the incumbent building management and control system (BMCS). An average energy reduction of 19{\%} and 32{\%} was achieved in the two buildings over 51 and 10 days of operation respectively without substantially affecting measured or modelled occupant thermal satisfaction levels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In order to operate an electrical distribution network in a secure and cost-efficient way, it becomes necessary, due to the rise of renewable energy based distributed generation, to develop Active Network Management (ANM) strategies. These strategies rely on short-term policies that control the power injected by generators and/or taken off by loads so as to avoid congestions or voltage problems. While simple ANM strategies would curtail the production of generators, more advanced ones would move the consumption of loads to relevant time periods so as to maximize the potential of renewable energy sources. However, such advanced strategies imply solving large-scale optimal sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty, something which is complex. In order to promote the development of computational techniques for active network management, we detail a generic procedure for formulating ANM decision problems as Markov Decision Processes. We also specify it to a 75-bus distribution network. The resulting test instance is available at http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/{\~{}}anm/. It can be used as testbed for comparing existing computational techniques as well as for developing new ones.},

abstract = {The ZIP load models consist of constant-impedance, constant-current, and constant-power loads, which is crucial to access the network performance. Generally, including the constant-impedance and constant-power load model in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is typically straightforward in convex formulations. However, further inclusion of an exact constant-current load model results in non-convex terms and is computationally challenging. Hence, this paper proposes a new approach for extending convex relaxations of OPF problems to include representations of ZIP load models. Exploiting knowledge of the reference bus' phase angle, this approach uses geometric relationships to relax the voltage magnitude expressions in order to model the constant-current components, thus enabling convex representations of ZIP load models. The proposed approach is applied to semidefinite, second-order cone and quadratic convex programming relaxations of the OPF problem and demonstrated using several test cases.},

abstract = {As the trend in electricity markets is strongly towards deregulation, new players, new rules and new behaviors will continue to emerge. One of the new developments on the demand side is purchases made by a coalition of consumers. It seems indeed likely that in the future this will be more common, and that coalitions of consumers will emerge when they are worthwhile. The aim of this paper is to study how such an organization of consumers can be set up in a hierarchical framework. This new approach has not been described before in the deregulated electricity markets but is clearly an important research topic. We focus our interest on electric space heating, which is an energy need especially important in the Nordic countries such as Finland. We examine the consumption strategies of individual electricity buyers within a coalition. The decision problem all consumers face is to find the optimal use of their space heating system with respect to changes in electricity prices and to their tolerance to indoor temperature variation. A mathematical model for this problem is defined. Physical parameters of sample houses were gathered from an experimental field test conducted in Helsinki during the winter of 1996. The coalition buys in the market at marginal cost. However, as marginal cost pricing may not always fulfill metering and communication needs of the members of the coalition, we consider Time-Of-Use (TOU) pricing within the coalition. Different groups of consumer behavior are constructed to simulate this coalition. The optimal marginal price is used as a reference point to estimate the nearest TOU price within the coalition.},

abstract = {After initiating a toxic air contaminant (TAC) identification and control program in 1984, the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations to reduce TAC emissions from cars, trucks, stationary sources, and consumer products. This study quantifies ambient concentration and emission trends for the period 1990-2012 for seven TACs that are responsible for most of the known cancer risk associated with airborne exposure in California. Of these seven, diesel particulate matter (DPM) is the most important; however DPM is not measured directly. Based on a novel surrogate method, DPM concentrations declined 68{\%}, even though the state's population increased 31{\%}, diesel vehicle-miles-traveled increased 81{\%}, and the gross state product (GSP) increased 74{\%}. Based on monitoring data, concentrations of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, perchloroethylene, and hexavalent chromium declined 88-94{\%}. Also, the ambient and emissions trends for each of these four TACs were similar. Furthermore, these declines generally occurred earlier in California than elsewhere. However, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are formed in the air photochemically from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), declined only 20-21{\%}. The collective cancer risk from exposure to these seven reviewed TACs declined 76{\%}. Significant reduction in cancer risk to California residents from implementation of air toxics controls (especially for DPM) is expected to continue.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) may reduce generator dispatch costs by as much as 10{\%}, saving millions of dollars annually. However, this conclusion has been deduced primarily from studies using the DC power flow approximation on two power networks derived from the IEEE 118-bus and RTS-96 cases. This paper is a systematic study of the OTS problem. Various OTS formulations are considered for computing primal and dual bounds on a variety of power networks. The results demonstrate that the DC power flow model is inadequate for solving the OTS problem, and that mixed-integer nonlinear optimization techniques are instrumental in finding high-quality primal and dual bounds. The paper also indicates that, on a variety of benchmarks, transmission line switching may bring generation cost reductions between 0{\%} to 29{\%}.},

This paper introduces a new exact algorithm for two important members of this family: i) the maximal covering location problem, which requires finding a subset of facilities that maximizes the amount of demand covered while respecting a budget constraint on the cost of the facilities; and ii) the partial set covering location problem, which minimizes the cost of the open facilities while forcing a certain amount of demand to be covered. We study an effective decomposition approach to the two problems based on the branch-and-Benders-cut reformulation. We also report the results of a series of computational experiments demonstrating that, thanks to this decomposition techniques, optimal solutions can be found very quickly, even for benchmark instances involving up to twenty million demand points.},

abstract = {A general formulation of the feeder reconfiguration problem for loss reduction and load balancing is given, and a novel solution method is presented. The solution uses a search over different radial configurations created by considering switchings of the branch exchange type. To guide the search, two different power flow approximation methods with varying degrees of accuracy have been developed and tested. The methods are used to calculate the new power flow in the system after a branch exchange and they make use of the power flow equations developed for radial distribution systems. Both accuracy analysis and the test results show that estimation methods can be used in searches to reconfigure a given system even if the system is not well compensated and reconfiguring involves load transfer between different substations. For load balancing, a load balance index is defined and it is shown that the search and power flow estimation methods developed for power loss reduction can also be used for load balancing since the two problems are similar},

abstract = {Optimization is at the core of control theory and appears in several areas of this field, such as optimal control, distributed control, system identification, robust control, state estimation, model predictive control and dynamic programming. The recent advances in various topics of modern optimization have also been revamping the area of machine learning. Motivated by the crucial role of optimization theory in the design, analysis, control and operation of real-world systems, this tutorial paper offers a detailed overview of some major advances in this area, namely conic optimization and its emerging applications. First, we discuss the importance of conic optimization in different areas. Then, we explain seminal results on the design of hierarchies of convex relaxations for a wide range of nonconvex problems. Finally, we study different numerical algorithms for large-scale conic optimization problems.},

abstract = {We consider linear programs with uncertain parameters, lying in some prescribed uncertainty set, where part of the variables must be determined before the realization of the uncertain parameters (non-adjustable variables), while the other part are variables that can be chosen after the realization (adjustable variables). We extend the Robust Optimization methodology (1, 3-6, 9, 13, 14) to this situation by introducing the Adjustable Robust Counterpart (ARC) associated with an LP of the above structure. Often the ARC is significantly less conservative than the usual Robust Counterpart (RC), however, in most cases the ARC is computationally intractable (NP-hard). This difficulty is addressed by restricting the adjustable variables to be affine functions of the uncertain data. The ensuing Affinely Adjustable Robust Counterpart (AARC) problem is then shown to be, in certain important cases, equivalent to a tractable optimization problem (typically an LP or a Semidefinite problem), and in other cases, having a tight approximation which is tractable. The AARC approach is illustrated by applying it to a multi-stage inventory management problem.},

Suggested formulations and solutions are given together with some computational experience to give the reader a feel for the computational difficulty of solving that particular type of model. Furthermore, this book illustrates the scope and limitations of mathematical programming, and shows how it can be applied to real situations. By emphasizing the importance of the building and interpreting of models rather than the solution process, the author attempts to fill a gap left by the many works which concentrate on the algorithmic side of the subject.},

Explicit conditions for existence and uniqueness of load-flow solutions are presented. These conditions also guarantee convergence of the load-flow algorithm to the unique solution. The proposed methodology is applicable to generic systems featuring (i) wye connections; (ii) ungrounded delta connections; (iii) a combination of wye-connected and delta-connected sources/loads; and, (iv) a combination of line-to-line and line-to-grounded-neutral devices at the secondary of distribution transformers. Further, a sufficient condition for the non-singularity of the load-flow Jacobian is proposed. Finally, linear load-flow models are derived, and their approximation accuracy is analyzed. Theoretical results are corroborated through experiments on IEEE test feeders.},

abstract = {This article investigates the combined low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) residential grid impact for slow and fast electric vehicle (EV) charging, for an increasing local penetration rate and for different residential slow charging strategies. A realistic case study for a Flemish urban distribution grid is used, for which three residential slow charging strategies are modeled: uncoordinated charging, residential off-peak charging, and EV-based peak shaving. For each slow charging strategy, the EV hosting capacity is determined, with and without the possibility of fast charging, while keeping the grid within its operating limits. The results show that the distribution grid impact is much less sensitive to the presence of fast charging compared to the slow charging strategy. EV-based peak shaving results in the lowest grid impact, allowing for the highest EV hosting capacity. Residential off-peak charging has the highest grid impact, due the load synchronization effect that occurs, resulting in the lowest EV hosting capacity. Therefore, the EV users should be incentivized to charge their EVs in a more grid-friendly manner when the local EV penetration rate becomes significant, as this increases the EV hosting capacity much more than the presence of fast charging decreases it.},

@article{Wolverton1974,
abstract = {The work of software cost forecasting falls into two parts. First we make what we call structural forecasts, and then we calculate the absolute dollar-volume forecasts. Structural forecasts describe the technology and function of a software project, but not its size. We allocate resources (costs) over the project's life cycle from the structural forecasts. Judgment, technical knowledge, and econometric research should combine in making the structural forecasts. A methodology based on a 25 X 7 structural forecast matrix that has been used by TRW with good results over the past few years is presented in this paper. With the structural forecast in hand, we go on to calculate the absolute dollar-volume forecasts. The general logic followed in "absolute" cost estimating can be based on either a mental process or an explicit algorithm. A cost estimating algorithm is presented and five tradition methods of software cost forecasting are described: top-down estimating, similarities and differences estimating, ratio estimating, standards estimating, and bottom-up estimating. All forecasting methods suffer from the need for a valid cost data base for many estimating situations. Software information elements that experience has shown to be useful in establishing such a data base are given in the body of the paper. Major pricing pitfalls are identified. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the software cost forecasting methodology and historical results. Topics for further work and study are suggested.},

abstract = {Energy storage may improve power management in microgrids that include renewable energy sources. The storage devices match energy generation to consumption, facilitating a smooth and robust energy balance within the microgrid. This paper addresses the optimal control of the microgrid's energy storage devices. Stored energy is controlled to balance power generation of renewable sources to optimize overall power consumption at the microgrid point of common coupling. Recent works emphasize constraints imposed by the storage device itself, such as limited capacity and internal losses. However, these works assume flat, highly simplified network models, which overlook the physical connectivity. This work proposes an optimal power flow solution that considers the entire system: the storage device limits, voltages limits, currents limits, and power limits. The power network may be arbitrarily complex, and the proposed solver obtains a globally optimal solution.},

Managing the stored energy usually presents a complicated optimization problem. In this paper, we show an optimal "peak shaving" strategy, that enables minimization of the power peak and derive an analytic design method for attaining optimal peak shaving. The analysis reveals the lowest possible peak, given only the load's demand profile and the storage capacity. The effects of losses in the storage device are analyzed numerically, showing the increase of power peak associated with the increase of loss. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Theoretical properties of the strengthened QC relaxation that show its dominance over the other variants of the QC relaxation studied in the literature are also derived. The effectiveness of the strengthened QC relaxation is corroborated via extensive numerical results on benchmark AC-OPF test networks. In particular, the results demonstrate that the proposed relaxation consistently provides the tightest variable bounds and optimality gaps with negligible impacts on runtime performance.},

We show that the nodal admittance matrix can be uniquely identified from a sequence of steady-state measurements when the system is fully observable, and a reduced admittance matrix, from Kron reduction, can be determined when the system contains some hidden nodes. Furthermore, we discuss conditions for identifying the full admittance matrix of a power system with hidden nodes and propose efficient algorithms based on graph theory and convex relaxation to determine the admittance matrix of both radial and mesh systems when these conditions are satisfied. Simulations performed on a standard test system where all nodes are monitored confirm that the proposed algorithms can provide an accurate estimate of the admittance matrix from noisy synchrophasor data.},

It helps us obtain the most appropriate distributed algorithm for a given network resource allocation problem, and quantifies the comparison across architectural alternatives of modularized network design. Decomposition theory naturally provides the mathematical language to build an analytic foundation for the design of modularized and distributed control of networks. In this tutorial paper, we first review the basics of convexity, Lagrange duality, distributed subgradient method, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterations, and implication of different time scales of variable updates. Then, we introduce primal, dual, indirect, partial, and hierarchical decompositions, focusing on network utility maximization problem formulations and the meanings of primal and dual decompositions in terms of network architectures. Finally, we present recent examples on: systematic search for alternative decompositions; decoupling techniques for coupled objective functions; and decoupling techniques for coupled constraint sets that are not readily decomposable},

abstract = {Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. Due to the OPF problem's non-convexity, there may exist multiple local optima. Certifiably obtaining the global solution is important for certain applications of OPF problems. Many global optimization techniques compute an optimality gap that compares the achievable objective value corresponding to the feasible point from a local solution algorithm with the objective value bound from a convex relaxation technique. Rather than the traditional practice of completely separating the local solution and convex relaxation computations, this paper proposes a method that exploits information from a local solution to speed the computation of an objective value bound using a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The improvement in computational tractability comes with the trade-off of reduced tightness for the resulting objective value bound. Numerical experiments illustrate this trade-off, with the proposed method being faster but weaker than the SDP relaxation and slower but tighter than second-order cone programming (SOCP) and quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for many large test cases.},

abstract = {Optimal power flow (OPF) is considered for microgrids, with the objective of minimizing either the power distribution losses, or, the cost of power drawn from the substation and supplied by distributed generation (DG) units, while effecting voltage regulation. The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing alternatives.},

abstract = {Although stochastic programming is a powerful tool for modeling decision-making under uncertainty, various impediments have historically prevented its wide-spread use. One factor involves the ability of non-specialists to easily express stochastic programming problems as extensions of their deterministic counterparts, which are typically formulated first. A second factor relates to the difficulty of solving stochastic programming models, particularly in the mixed-integer, non-linear, and/or multi-stage cases. Intricate, configurable, and parallel decomposition strategies are frequently required to achieve tractable run-times on large-scale problems. We simultaneously address both of these factors in our PySP software package, which is part of the Coopr open-source Python repository for optimization; the latter is distributed as part of IBM's COIN-OR repository. To formulate a stochastic program in PySP, the user specifies both the deterministic base model (supporting linear, non-linear, and mixed-integer components) and the scenario tree model (defining the problem stages and the nature of uncertain parameters) in the Pyomo open-source algebraic modeling language. Given these two models, PySP provides two paths for solution of the corresponding stochastic program. The first alternative involves passing an extensive form to a standard deterministic solver. For more complex stochastic programs, we provide an implementation of Rockafellar and Wets' Progressive Hedging algorithm. Our particular focus is on the use of Progressive Hedging as an effective heuristic for obtaining approximate solutions to multi-stage stochastic programs. By leveraging the combination of a high-level programming language (Python) and the embedding of the base deterministic model in that language (Pyomo), we are able to provide completely generic and highly configurable solver implementations. PySP has been used by a number of research groups, including our own, to rapidly prototype and solve difficult stochastic programming problems.},

In all these cases, we also show that a linear objective can be optimized in polynomial time over these sets. Towards the application side, we show how these sets relate to commonly occurring substructures of a general quadratically constrained quadratic program. To further illustrate the benefit of studying quadratically constrained quadratic programs from a rank-1 perspective, we propose new rank-1 formulations for the generalized pooling problem and use our convexification results to obtain several new convex relaxations for the pooling problem. Finally, we run a comprehensive set of computational experiments and show that our convexification results together with discretization significantly help in improving dual bounds for the generalized pooling problem.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {—This paper deals with the non-convex power system state estimation (PSSE) problem, which plays a central role in the monitoring and operation of electric power networks. Given a set of noisy measurements, the goal of the PSSE problem is to estimate the vector of complex voltages at all buses of the network (i.e., the state of the system). As the noiseless counterpart of the PSSE, a related power flow (PF) problem is first studied, which is cast as a constrained minimization program by adding a suitably designed objective function. We propose a convex-ification framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP) and second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxations to cope with its inherent non-convexity. We study the performance of the proposed framework in the case where the set of measurements includes: (i) nodal voltage magnitudes, and (ii) branch active power flows over a spanning tree of the network. It is shown that the SDP and SOCP relaxations both recover the true PF solution as long as the voltage angle difference across each line of the network is not too large (e.g., less than 90 • for lossless networks). By capitalizing on this result, penalized SDP and SOCP problems are designed to solve the PSSE, where a penalty based on the weighted least absolute value is incorporated for fitting noisy measurements with possible bad data. Strong theoretical results are derived to quantify the optimal solution of the penalized SDP problem, which is shown to possess a dominant rank-one component formed by lifting the true voltage vector. An upper bound on the estimation error is also derived as a function of the noise power, which decreases exponentially fast as the number of measurements increases. Numerical results on benchmark systems, including a 9241-bus European system, are reported to corroborate the merits of the proposed convexification framework.},

@article{Babaeinejadsarookolaee2019,
abstract = {In recent years, the power systems research community has seen an explosion of novel methods for formulating the AC power flow equations. Consequently, benchmarking studies using the seminal AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem have emerged as the primary method for evaluating these emerging methods. However, it is often difficult to directly compare these studies due to subtle differences in the AC-OPF problem formulation as well as the network, generation, and loading data that are used for evaluation. To help address these challenges, this IEEE PES Task Force report proposes a standardized AC-OPF mathematical formulation and the PGLib-OPF networks for benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms. A motivating study demonstrates some limitations of the established network datasets in the context of benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms and a validation study demonstrates the efficacy of using the PGLib-OPF networks for this purpose. In the interest of scientific discourse and future additions, the PGLib-OPF benchmark library is open-access and all the of network data is provided under a creative commons license.},

@article{Braslavsky2017,
abstract = {IEEE The growing uptake of solar power in low-voltage grids across the world has drawn attention to potential overvoltage issues. In an effort to mitigate overvoltage, automatic Volt-Watt and Volt-VAR inverter response functions have been introduced in recent standards. The utility of these functions has been established in a number of recent studies. However, relatively little analysis exists on the stability of grid-connected inverters where decentralised operation of these response functions can potentially trigger undesirable interactions. This paper presents a rigorous stability analysis of a grid-connected inverter under simultaneous operation of automatic Volt-Watt and Volt-VAR response functions. Conditions for the existence of an equilibrium voltage are established together with tests that characterise its stability in terms of the inverter and line parameters. The analysis reveals a little-known stability vulnerability arising when both Volt-Watt and Volt-VAR functions are in operation if Watt output takes precedence over the provision of VAR support, a generally recommended setting. To circumvent this vulnerability, the proposed stability tests allow parameter selection for guaranteed stability margins. A safe configuration alternative is also identified to avoid instability at the expense of real power output. Numerical methods to compute equilibrium voltages are presented and used in two illustrative numerical studies.},

abstract = {New car fleet fuel economy, weight and engine power have changed drastically since 1980. These changes represent both movements along and shifts in the "fuel economy/weight/engine power production possibilities frontier". This paper estimates the technological progress that has occurred since 1980 and the trade-offs that manufacturers and consumers face when choosing between fuel economy, weight and engine power characteristics. The results suggest that if weight, horsepower and torque were held at their 1980 levels, fuel economy for both passenger cars and light trucks could have increased by nearly 50 percent from 1980 to 2006; this is in stark contrast to the 15 percent by which fuel economy actually increased. I also find that once technological progress is considered, meeting the CAFE standards adopted in 2007 will require halting the observed increases in weight and engine power characteristics, but little more; in contrast, the standards recently announced by the new administration, while certainly attainable, require non- trivial "downsizing". I also investigate the relative efficiencies of manufacturers. I find that US manufacturers tend to be above the median in terms of their passenger vehicle fuel efficiency conditional on weight and engine power, and are among the top for light duty trucks; Honda is the most efficient manufacturer for both passenger cars, while Volvo is the most efficient manufacturer of light duty trucks. However, I also find that over time, US manufacturers' relative efficiency in both passenger cars and light trucks has degraded. These results may provide insight into their current financial troubles. eScholarship},

Here we analyse the authors' methodology and find it problematic. The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low economic cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, which the authors have evaluated positively elsewhere, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and decreasing in cost every year.},

abstract = {The actual contribution of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles (PHEV and BEV) to greenhouse gas mitigation depends on their real-world usage. Often BEV are seen as superior as they drive only electrically and do not have any direct emissions during driving. However, empirical evidence on which vehicle electrifies more mileage with a given battery capacity is lacking. Here, we present the first systematic overview of empirical findings on actual PHEV and BEV usage for the US and Germany. Contrary to common belief, PHEV with about 60 km of real-world range currently electrify as many annual vehicles kilometres as BEV with a much smaller battery. Accordingly, PHEV recharged from renewable electricity can highly contribute to green house gas mitigation in car transport. Including the higher CO2eq emissions during the production phase of BEV compared to PHEV, PHEV show today higher CO2eq savings then BEVs compared to conventional vehicles. However, for significant CO2eq improvements of PHEV and particularly of BEVs the decarbonisation of the electricity system should go on.},

abstract = {The power transfer capability of existing transmission networks can be enhanced through the use of automated system protection schemes (SPS), which rapidly respond to disturbances on the network to keep the system's variables within operational bounds. However, reliance on such schemes may expose the network to large impacts-including blackouts-if the SPS does not respond as designed, so the deployment of SPS should balance risks and benefits. This paper formulates a risk-based cost-benefit framework that allows the operator to strike an optimal balance between constraint costs and risks of demand curtailment due to malfunctioning SPS. It is applied to a simple 4-bus power system inspired by the GB network, for which an exact optimisation problem can be formulated. A component-based dependability model is developed for the SPS to determine its failure modes and associated probabilities. The resulting cost-minimisation problem is solved for a range of operating conditions and SPS reliability levels. The results consistently show cost savings from the use of an SPS, even if it is highly unreliable, when a hedging strategy may be used. The optimal solution is highly sensitive to the problem parameters, but it is demonstrated that optimal operational strategies are associated with particular SPS outcomes. This finding may be used as empirical guidance to develop operational strategies for complex networks with unreliable SPS.},

abstract = {Analytic methods to quantify power systems stability margins while acknowledging uncertainty will be critical in dynamic security assessment due to the integration of renewable resources and uncontrollable loads. Lyapunov's direct method provides a mathematical framework to assess stability margins. However, analytical construction of Lyapunov functions are limited to very restrictive settings and cannot be extended to accommodate the impact of uncertainty. This paper focuses on the algorithmic construction of Lyapunov functions and the estimation of the robust Region-Of-Attraction (ROA) with sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs which can be translated into semidefinite problems and then solved with readily available software. Key to the proposed approach is the formulation of computationally tractable polynomial differential equation models that are affine in parametric/input uncertainty. Numerical case studies for a prototypical power system model validate the accuracy of the polynomial approximations and compare the ROA and the robust ROA with results from repeated time-domain simulations.},

@article{Laughton1968,
abstract = {The analysis of unbalanced-power-system problems depends usually on transformation methods by which the primary or phase quantities are substituted by, for example, symmetrical-component quantities. These transformations have had computational advantages in the past, but with the use of the digital computer, they no longer appear to be necessary. Investigations into system-unbalance problems and their solution using only the actual system phase voltages, currents and impedances show that a major difficulty concerns the representation of transformers. In this paper the principles of transformer models in phase co-ordinates are derived and applied to the development of the phase equivalent circuits of a number of balanced and unbalanced polyphase multiwinding transformers. The basic element of these equivalent circuits is shown to be a symmetrical lattice network that is bilinear in all cases except for quadrature boosting transformers. With these equivalent circuits and with the phase representations of the transmission lines, generators and other system components it is then possible to solve unbalanced polyphase network problems entirely in phase co-ordinates, retaining symmetrical components only as measures of system unbalance.},

The paper first provides a general discussion of the approximations associated with using a dc model, with an emphasis on the impact these approximations will have on security constrained OPF (SCOPF) results and LMP values. Then, since the impact of the approximations can be quite system specific, the paper provides case studies using both a small 37 bus system and a somewhat larger 12,965 bus model of the Midwest U.S. transmission grid. Results are provided comparing both the accuracy and the computational requirements of the two models. The general conclusion is that while there is some loss of accuracy using the dc approximation, the results actually match fairly closely with the full ac solution.},

In this paper, we focus on the unique role of the parameter time in the context of visually driven data analysis. We will discuss three major aspects—visualization, analysis, and the user. It will be illustrated that it is necessary to consider the characteristics of time when generating visual representations. For that purpose, we take a look at different types of time and present visual examples. Integrating visual and analytical methods has become an increasingly important issue. Therefore, we present our experiences in temporal data abstraction, principal component analysis, and clustering of larger volumes of time-oriented data. The third main aspect we discuss is supporting user-centered visual analysis. We describe event-based visualization as a promising means to adapt the visualization pipeline to needs and tasks of users.},

abstract = {Despite our extensive knowledge of biophysical properties of neurons, there is no commonly accepted algorithmic theory of neuronal function. Here we explore the hypothesis that single-layer neuronal networks perform online symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) of the similarity matrix of the streamed data. By starting with the SNMF cost function we derive an online algorithm, which can be implemented by a biologically plausible network with local learning rules. We demonstrate that such network performs soft clustering of the data as well as sparse feature discovery. The derived algorithm replicates many known aspects of sensory anatomy and biophysical properties of neurons including unipolar nature of neuronal activity and synaptic weights, local synaptic plasticity rules and the dependence of learning rate on cumulative neuronal activity. Thus, we make a step towards an algorithmic theory of neuronal function, which should facilitate large-scale neural circuit simulations and biologically inspired artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {We develop DeepOPF as a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach for solving direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problems. DeepOPF is inspired by the observation that solving DC-OPF for a given power network is equivalent to characterizing a high-dimensional mapping between the load inputs and the dispatch and transmission decisions. We construct and train a DNN model to learn such mapping, then we apply it to obtain optimized operating decisions upon arbitrary load inputs. We adopt uniform sampling to address the over-fitting problem common in generic DNN approaches. We leverage on a useful structure in DC-OPF to significantly reduce the mapping dimension, subsequently cutting down the size of our DNN model and the amount of training data/time needed. We also design a post-processing procedure to ensure the feasibility of the obtained solution. Simulation results of IEEE test cases show that DeepOPF always generates feasible solutions with negligible optimality loss, while speeding up the computing time by two orders of magnitude as compared to conventional approaches implemented in a state-of-the-art solver.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We model post-contingency corrective actions in the security-constrained economic dispatch and consider multiple stages of rescheduling to meet different security constraints. The resulting linear program is not solvable by traditional LP methods due to its large size. We devise and implement a series of algorithmic enhancements based on the Benders' decomposition method to ameliorate the computational difficulty. These enhancements include reducing the number of subproblems, solving the LPs faster by using appropriate solver options, harnessing parallel computing and treating difficult contingencies separately by integrating an independent “feasibility checker” process in the algorithm. In addition, we propose a set of online measures to diagnose and correct infeasibility issues encountered in the solution process. The overall solution approach, coded directly in GAMS, is able to process the “N-1” contingency list in 10 min for all large network cases (e.g., the Polish 2383-bus case) available for experiments.},

@article{Kocuk2017,
abstract = {Alternating current optimal power flow (AC OPF) is one of the most fundamental optimization problems in electrical power systems. It can be formulated as a semidef-inite program (SDP) with rank constraints. Solving AC OPF, that is, obtaining near optimal primal solutions as well as high quality dual bounds for this non-convex pro-gram, presents a major computational challenge to today's power industry for the real-time operation of large-scale power grids. In this paper, we propose a new technique for reformulation of the rank constraints using both principal and non-principal 2-by-2 minors of the involved Hermitian matrix variable and characterize all such minors into three types. We show the equivalence of these minor constraints to the physical constraints of voltage angle differences summing to zero over three-and four-cycles in the power network. We study second-order conic programming (SOCP) relaxations of this minor reformulation and propose strong cutting planes, convex envelopes, and bound tightening techniques to strengthen the resulting SOCP relaxations. We then propose an SOCP-based spatial branch-and-cut method to obtain the global optimum of AC OPF. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SDP-based OPF solver and on a simple personal computer is able to obtain on average a 0.71{\%} optimality gap in no more than 720 seconds for the most challenging power system instances in the literature.},

abstract = {This paper considers a probabilistic version of the {\$}N-k{\$} interdiction problem in power transmission networks, where the probability of failure of each component in the network is known a priori and the goal of the problem is to find a set of {\$}k{\$} components that maximizes disruption to the system loads weighted by the probability of simultaneous failure of the {\$}k{\$} components. The resulting problem is formulated as a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear program. Convex relaxations, linear approximations, and heuristics are developed to obtain feasible solutions that are close to the optimum. A general cutting-plane algorithm is proposed to solve the convex relaxation and linear approximations of the {\$}N-k{\$} problem. Extensive numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on small-, medium-, and large-scale test instances; the test instances include the IEEE 14-bus system, the IEEE single-area and three-area RTS96 systems, the IEEE 118-bus system, and the WECC 240 test system.},

In the nonlinear AC setting, the model is a large-scale nonconvex problem and is difficult to solve. A novel solution approach is proposed to deal with the scale and nonconvexity issues separately and effectively. The key point is to approximate the nonconvex AC feasibility problem with its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and use these SDP models as a convex subproblem within a Benders' decomposition framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior solution quality of this approach and its tractability for IEEE test cases, while suggesting future work for computational improvements on large-scale problems.},

abstract = {IEEE Flexible loads such as residential air-conditioners (ACs) can be directly controlled to provide demand-side regulation and balance services in electricity grids. Large aggregations of ACs offer a resource akin to that of a distributed energy storage system, which may be used to compensate fluctuations in the power output of local renewable energy generation. This paper formulates distributed and centralised model predictive control (MPC) strategies to balance fluctuations in solar power generation by directly controlling the aggregate demand of clusters of distributed residential ACs. The proposed receding-horizon control strategies rely on a new second-order linear time-varying model for the aggregate demand response of a population of heterogeneous ACs to changes in thermostat setpoints under varying ambient temperature. The performance of the proposed MPC strategies is analysed in a numerical simulation study implementing AC demand tracking of 1-minute fluctuations in actual PV capacity based on persistence and sky imager short-term solar forecasts. The results show that distributed and centralised MPC strategies achieve comparable performance, with better performance of persistence forecasts in a shorter prediction horizon, and better performance with sky imager forecasts on a longer prediction horizon.},

abstract = {Sparse regression and variable selection for large-scale data have been rapidly developed in the past decades. This work focuses on sparse ridge regression, which considers the exact {\$}L{\_}0{\$} norm to pursue the sparsity. We pave out a theoretical foundation to understand why many existing approaches may not work well for this problem, in particular on large-scale datasets. Inspired by reformulating the problem as a chance-constrained program, we derive a novel mixed integer second order conic (MISOC) reformulation and prove that its continuous relaxation is equivalent to that of the convex integer formulation proposed in a recent work. Based upon these two formulations, we develop two new scalable algorithms, the greedy and randomized algorithms, for sparse ridge regression with desirable theoretical properties. The proposed algorithms are proved to yield near-optimal solutions under mild conditions. In the case of much larger dimensions, we propose to integrate the greedy algorithm with the randomized algorithm, which can greedily search the features from the nonzero subset identified by the continuous relaxation of the MISOC formulation. The merits of the proposed methods are elaborated through a set of numerical examples in comparison with several existing ones.},

abstract = {Instrumenting power networks with phasor measurement units (PMUs) facilitates several tasks including optimum power flow, system control, contingency analysis, visualization, and integration of renewable resources, thus enabling situational awareness - one of the key steps toward realizing the smart grid vision. The installation cost of PMUs currently prohibits their deployment on every bus, which in turn motivates their strategic placement across the power grid. As state estimation is at the core of grid monitoring, PMU deployment is optimized here based on estimation-theoretic criteria. Considering both voltage and current PMU readings and incorporating conventionally derived state estimates under the Bayesian framework, PMU placement is formulated as an optimal experimental design task. To obviate the combinatorial search involved, a convex relaxation is also developed to obtain solutions with numerical optimality guarantees. In the tests performed on standard IEEE 14- and 118-bus benchmarks, the proposed relaxation is very close to and oftentimes attains the optimum.},

There is a growing body of work on the use of semidefinite programming relaxations to solve OPF. The relaxation is exact if and only if the corresponding optimal solution set contains a rank-one matrix. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions guaranteeing the nonexistence of a rank-one matrix in said optimal solution set. In particular, we show that under mild assumptions on problem nondegeneracy, any optimal solution to the semidefinite relaxation will have rank greater than one, if the number of equality and active inequality constraints is at least twice the number of buses in the network. The sufficient condition holds for arbitrary network topologies (including tree networks). We empirically evaluate the practical implications of these results on several test cases from the literature.},

@article{Rowe2013,
abstract = {The term microgrid is usually reserved for a modest sized, local distributed generation network that will largely operate standalone (i.e., without a grid connection.) The most common power flow control method utilized in a standalone microgrid is a technique known as power–frequency droop. This paper introduces the concept of utilizing an arctan function for the power–frequency droop profile. The use of this arctan function improves the small signal stability of the two-inverter microgrid, provides natural frequency bounding, and is flexible in its application. SABER simulations are performed to obtain the operating points about which the system is linearized for the stability analysis. Experimental results obtained from a dSPACE-controlled, low-voltage, two-inverter hardware system are presented to verify the theoretical and simulation results.},

@book{Gabriel2013a,
abstract = {This book focuses on the first issue and provides models and tools to math- ematically represent the hierarchy involved in anticipating market outcomes (bilevel models) and the result of the interaction of all market agents (equi- librium models). Since many energy markets are cleared with the purpose of maximizing social welfare, the description of such clearing mechanism can be conveniently formulated as an optimization problem. On the other hand, any market agent seeking tomaximize its profit/utility needs to anticipatemarket outcomes (which result from the maximum welfare optimization problem). This structure involves a hierarchy: an optimization problem constrained by other optimization problems. The interactions among all the market agents, each one pursuing its maximum profit/utility, result in what we call an equi- librium. Such hierarchical and equilibrium models are of interest in energy markets, and particulary in electricity and natural gasmarkets. Precisemath- ematical models can be derived to describe the behavior of market partici- pants and of the market as a whole. This mathematical characterization of energy markets makes particularly useful the MPEC (mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints) and EPEC (equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints) as well as the ba- sic MCP (mixed complementarity problem) and VI (variational inequality) approaches described and analyzed in this book.},

To this end, we propose two novel filtering techniques relying on the comparison at an intermediate PSCOPF solution of post-contingency constraint violations among postulated contingencies. We assess these techniques by comparing them with severity index-based filtering schemes, on a 60-and a 118-bus system. Our results show that the proposed contingency filtering techniques lead to faster solution of the PSCOPF, while being more robust and meaningful, than severity-index based ones.},

abstract = {Stochastic optimization is an umbrella term that includes over a dozen fragmented communities, using a patchwork of often overlapping notational systems with algorithmic strategies that are suited to specific classes of problems. This paper reviews the canonical models of these communities, and proposes a universal modeling framework that encompasses all of these competing approaches. At the heart is an objective function that optimizes over policies which is standard in some approaches, but foreign to others. We then identify four meta-classes of policies that encompasses all of the approaches that we have identified in the research literature or industry practice. In the process, we observe that any adaptive learning algorithm, whether it is derivative-based or derivative-free, is a form of policy that can be tuned to optimize either the cumulative reward (similar to multi-armed bandit problems) or final reward (as is used in ranking and selection or stochastic search). We argue that the principles of bandit problems, long a niche community, should become a core dimension of mainstream stochastic optimization.},

@article{Sundar2016,
abstract = {As renewable wind energy penetration rates continue to increase, one of the major challenges facing grid operators is the question of how to control transmission grids in a reliable and a cost-efficient manner. The stochastic nature of wind forces an alteration of traditional methods for solving day-ahead and look-ahead unit commitment and dispatch. In particular, uncontrollable wind generation increases the risk of random component failures. To address these questions, we present an N-1 Security and Chance-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCCUC) that includes the modeling of generation reserves that respond to wind fluctuations and tertiary reserves to account for single component outages. The basic formulation is reformulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem to limit the probability of failure. We develop three different algorithms to solve the problem to optimality and present a detailed case study on the IEEE RTS-96 single area system. The case study assesses the economic impacts due to contingencies and various degrees of wind power penetration into the system and also corroborates the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

Given that combinatorial SDP relaxations are often sparse, a technique known as clique tree conversion can sometimes reduce complexity substantially. In this paper, we describe a dualized verison of clique tree conversion, and prove that the technique allows any general-purpose interior-point method to solve a large class of sparse SDPs with a guaranteed complexity of {\$}O(n{\^{}}{\{}1.5{\}}L){\$} time and {\$}O(n){\$} memory. To illustrate the use of this technique, we solve the MAX {\$}k{\$}-CUT relaxation, the Lovasz Theta problem, and the AC optimal power flow relaxation, on power system models with up to {\$}n=13659{\$} nodes.},

The test system, is however, sufficiently small that students can analyze it using hand calculations or by developing small computer programs to fully understand the reliability models and evaluation techniques. Overall power system reliability evaluation is concerned with providing acceptable customer service. This is an important concern in today's electric utility environment. This should therefore be an essential element in teaching power system reliability evaluation at either the graduate or undergraduate level, The extended test system presented in this paper and the concepts presented assist in satisfying this requirement},

@article{Kazmi2019,
abstract = {efficiency of current energy use and transitioning to a cleaner energy mix to meet the residual demand. This requires a fundamental rethink of how the energy value-chain is organized at present. A key technology to enable the sustainability transition is through employing demand side management to leverage flexibility at multiple scales. Demand side management encompasses both demand reduction and demand response of controllable or flexible loads via automatic control or user engagement. Notable examples of flexible loads at the residential building level - which forms the focus of this thesis - include electric batteries, and thermostatically controllable loads such as hot water systems. Unlike electric batteries, modelling and controlling thermostatically controllable loads (such as electric heaters, heat pumps etc.) poses a more challenging problem. However, they make up for a substantial fraction of energy demand in many European countries, and can provide energy flexibility at a far cheaper price point than electric storage. Controlling thermostatically controllable loads is hard because of the general non-existence of a model which can be used to describe their behaviour. This model is necessary to control the load in a way which is beneficial for both the user and the grid. In its absence, naive rule-based controllers are frequently employed which perform demonstrably sub-optimally. Historically, this modelling step has been carried out by human domain experts creating models using first principles, or fitting reduced order models to data observed during offline testing. However, these approaches only work in practice for large scale installations; for residential loads, it is neither feasible nor cost-effective to create individualized models. A recent solution to the control problem has been to adopt model-free reinforcement learning which does away with the need for a model by translating observations directly to (optimal) control actions. However, at its heart, this approach also requires extensive state estimation, besides being relatively non-interpretible, data-intensive and incompatible with most legacy optimization code. This thesis presents a transfer learning based framework which allows modelling of thermostatically controllable loads in a completely data-driven manner. Furthermore, by transferring knowledge across multiple domains and tasks, it substantially accelerates the learning process. The models learned this way are not only interpretible, they are also data-efficient and compatible with many existing optimizers. Through trials conducted on both simulated and real world hot water systems, this thesis shows that (observation) time is largely interchangable with agency. In other words, by increasing the number of thermostatically controllable systems under consideration, it is possible to vastly improve the modelling accuracy while reducing the time period required to achieve it. This effect extends to both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, although the optimal mechanism to achieve it is different in either case. The thesis also shows that models learned using transfer learning can be used to provide a number of other services, unlike with model-free reinforcement learning. Foremost amongst these is the possibility to optimize the operation of the hot water system (the form of thermostatically controllable loads considered in this thesis) according to a number of different objectives. This thesis focuses on optimizing the energy efficiency of hot water systems and demonstrates energy savings of around 20{\%}, or over 200 kWh per household annually, for 53 Dutch households in a trial that lasted an entire year. These results were obtained by combining the learned model with an extremely simple controller. By making use of more sophisticated controllers, it is possible to further increase these savings to almost 300 kWh per household annually, while also making it possible to achieve other objectives, such as maximal consumption of local solar generation or cost optimization etc. It is also possible to make use of the developed models for diagnostic purposes. An example is to estimate the flexibility inherent to the hot water systems, and their possible impact on the future electricity grid. In doing so, it becomes possible to not only quantify the adverse effect of large scale heat electrification, but also to what degree the installed thermostatically controllable loads can be part of the solution. Finally, the model also enables other services, such as engaging users to further reduce their energy demand and diagnosing operational faults. Developing an interpretible, data-driven model also paves the way to close the loop between operational and design optimization. The thesis concludes by taking a step back from demonstrating demand reduction and response in countries with reliable grids, and considers the case of developing countries where daily electricity outages are symptomatic of an unreliable electric grid today. Unlike in developing countries, these outages have led to mass adoption of (inefficient) electric storage. By considering Pakistan as an exemplar for such developing countries, the thesis presents an estimate of the flexibility inherent in existing electric storage, and discusses potential methods to utilize it optimally by contrasting the value creation ecosystem with developed countries. At its heart, the thesis shows that it is possible to achieve demand reduction and response even in extremely efficient modern buildings. The efficiency gains achieved in this way are enabled by the underlying energy flexibility, which can also be used to provide other services. Such a data-driven approach not only holds the potential to substantially reduce the carbon footprint of the building stock, it also paves the way for future research into developing synergies between various facets of design and operational optimization in buildings.},

The pyomo.dae framework is integrated with the Pyomo open source algebraic modeling language, and is available at http: //www.pyomo.org. One key feature of pyomo.dae is that it does not restrict users to standard, predefined forms of differential equations, providing a high degree of modeling flexibility and the ability to express constraints that cannot be easily specified in other modeling frameworks. Other key features of pyomo.dae are the ability to specify optimization problems with high-order differential equations and partial differential equations, defined on restricted domain types, and the ability to automatically transform high-level abstract models into finite-dimensional algebraic problems that can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Moreover, pyomo.dae users can leverage existing capabilities of Pyomo to embed differential equation models within stochastic and integer programming models and mathematical programs with equilibrium constraint formulations. Collectively, these features enable the exploration of new modeling concepts, discretization schemes, and the benchmarking of state-of-the-art optimization solvers.},

The objective of capacitor placement is peak power and energy loss reduction, taking into account the cost of the capacitors. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. The power flows in the system are explicitly represented, and the voltage constraints are incorporated. A solution method has been implemented that decomposes the problem into a master problem and a slave problem. The master problem is used to determine the location of the capacitors. The slave problem is used by the master problem to determine the type and size of the capacitors placed on the system. In solving the slave problem, an efficient phase I-phase II algorithm is used.},

abstract = {The application of semidefinite programming (SDP) to power system problems has recently attracted substantial research interest. Specifically, a recent SDP formulation offers a convex relaxation to the well-known, typically nonconvex {\&}{\#}x201C;optimal power flow{\&}{\#}x201D; (OPF) problem. This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a nonzero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of this paper investigates an SDP approach utilizing modified objective and constraints to compute all solutions of the nonlinear power flow equations. Several variants are described. Results suggest SDP's promise as an efficient algorithm for identifying large numbers of solutions to the power flow equations.},

abstract = {The growing amount of fluctuating renewable infeeds and market liberalization increases uncertainty in power system operation. To capture the influence of fluctuations in operational planning, we model the forecast errors of the uncertain in-feeds as random variables and formulate a security constrained optimal power flow using chance constraints. The chance constraints limit the probability of violations of technical constraints, such as generation and transmission limits, but require a tractable reformulation. In this paper, we discuss different analytical reformulations of the chance constraints, based on a given set of assumptions concerning the forecast error distributions. In particular, we discuss reformulations that do not assume a normal distribution, and admit an analytical reformulation given only a mean vector and covariance matrix. We illustrate our method with a case study of the IEEE 118 bus system, based on real data from the European system. The different reformulations are compared in terms of both achieved empirical violation probability and operational cost, which allows us to provide a suggestion for the most appropriate reformulation in an optimal power flow setting. For a large number of uncertainty sources, it is observed that the distributions of the line flows and generator outputs can be close to normal, even though the power injections are not normally distributed.},

In Part II, we address variability, economics, and policy of WWS energy. We estimate that {\~{}}3,800,000 5 MW wind turbines, {\~{}}49,000 300. MW concentrated solar plants, {\~{}}40,000 300. MW solar PV power plants, {\~{}}1.7 billion 3 kW rooftop PV systems, {\~{}}5350 100. MW geothermal power plants, {\~{}}270 new 1300. MW hydroelectric power plants, {\~{}}720,000 0.75. MW wave devices, and {\~{}}490,000 1. MW tidal turbines can power a 2030 WWS world that uses electricity and electrolytic hydrogen for all purposes. Such a WWS infrastructure reduces world power demand by 30{\%} and requires only {\~{}}0.41{\%} and {\~{}}0.59{\%} more of the world's land for footprint and spacing, respectively. We suggest producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing the pre-existing energy by 2050. Barriers to the plan are primarily social and political, not technological or economic. The energy cost in a WWS world should be similar to that today. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many optimization problems gain from being interpreted and solved in either primal or dual form. For a user with a particular application, one of these forms is usually much more natural to use, but this is not always the most efficient one. This paper presents an implementation in the optimization modelling tool YALMIP that allows the user to define conic optimization problems in a preferred format, and then automatically derive a symbolic YALMIP model of the dual of this problem, solve the dual, and recover original variables. Applications in flexible generation of sum-of-squares programs, and efficient formulations of large-scale experiment design problems are used as illustrative examples.},

@article{Wenzel2013,
abstract = {The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently updated its 2003 and 2010 logistic regression analyses of the effect of a reduction in light-duty vehicle mass on US societal fatality risk per vehicle mile traveled (VMT; Kahane, 2012). Societal fatality risk includes the risk to both the occupants of the case vehicle as well as any crash partner or pedestrians. The current analysis is the most thorough investigation of this issue to date. This paper replicates the Kahane analysis and extends it by testing the sensitivity of his results to changes in the definition of risk, and the data and control variables used in the regression models. An assessment by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) indicates that the estimated effect of mass reduction on risk is smaller than in Kahane's previous studies, and is statistically non-significant for all but the lightest cars (Wenzel, 2012a). The estimated effects of a reduction in mass or footprint (i.e. wheelbase times track width) are small relative to other vehicle, driver, and crash variables used in the regression models. The recent historical correlation between mass and footprint is not so large to prohibit including both variables in the same regression model; excluding footprint from the model, i.e. allowing footprint to decrease with mass, increases the estimated detrimental effect of mass reduction on risk in cars and crossover utility vehicles (CUVs)/minivans, but has virtually no effect on light trucks. Analysis by footprint deciles indicates that risk does not consistently increase with reduced mass for vehicles of similar footprint. Finally, the estimated effects of mass and footprint reduction are sensitive to the measure of exposure used (fatalities per induced exposure crash, rather than per VMT), as well as other changes in the data or control variables used. It appears that the safety penalty from lower mass can be mitigated with careful vehicle design, and that manufacturers can reduce mass as a strategy to increase their vehicles' fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without necessarily compromising societal safety.},

abstract = {OAPA Linear power flow (LPF) is necessary for robust and fast centralized control of active distribution networks (ADNs). With penetration of distributed generators (DGs) into ADN, voltage-controlled nodes are becoming more common, to maintain a normal voltage profile in the distribution network. Existing three-phase LPF formulations under a rectangular coordinate system cannot cope with local voltage-controlled nodes, and does not consider multi-slack-node features of three-phase distribution network, detailed control characteristics and loss participation features of DGs. Here, a general three-phase LPF under a polar coordinate system is presented to address these issues. The proposed method can account for various connection ZIP loads, transformers, and single-phase or three-phase DGs. The detailed control model of the DGs and the distributed slack bus are taken into account. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are validated with balanced 33, 70, 84, 119, 874-node networks and modified IEEE 13, 34, 37, 123 unbalanced networks.},

abstract = {Higher levels of renewable electricity generation increase uncertainty in power system operation. To ensure secure system operation, new tools that account for this uncertainty are required. In this paper, we formulate a chance-constrained AC optimal power flow problem, which guarantees that generation, power flows and voltages remain within their bounds with a pre-defined probability. We then propose an accurate, yet tractable analytical reformulation of the chance constraints. The reformulation maintains the full, non-linear AC power flow equations for the forecasted operating point, and models the impact of uncertainty through a linearization around this point. We discuss different solution algorithms, including one-shot optimization with and without recourse, and an iterative algorithm which enables scalable implementations. We further discuss how more general chance constraint reformulations can be incorporated within the iterative solution algorithm. In a case study based on four different IEEE systems, we compare the performance of the solution algorithms, and demonstrate scalability of the iterative scheme. We further show that the analytical reformulation accurately and efficiently enforces chance constraints in both in- and out-of-sample tests, and that the analytical approach outperforms two alternative, sample based chance constraint reformulations.},

In this paper, we investigate the situation where generation lower bounds are present. We show that even for a two-bus one-generator system, the SDP relaxation can have all possible approximation outcomes, that is (1) SDP relaxation may be exact or (2) SDP relaxation may be inexact or (3) SDP relaxation may be feasible while the OPF instance may be infeasible. We provide a complete characterization of when these three approximation outcomes occur and an analytical expression of the resulting optimality gap for this two-bus system. In order to facilitate further research, we design a library of instances over radial networks in which the SDP relaxation has positive optimality gap. Finally, we propose valid inequalities and variable bound tightening techniques that significantly improve the computational performance of a global optimization solver. Our work demonstrates the need of developing efficient global optimization methods for the solution of OPF even in the simple but fundamental case of radial networks.},

It is better to treat REG as stochastic variables in the distribution network OPF. In addition, distribution networks are unbalanced in nature. Thus, in this paper, a chance constrained optimization-based multiobjective OPF model is formulated to consider the forecast errors of REG in the short-term operation of radial unbalanced distribution networks. In the model, expected total active power losses of distribution lines, expected overload risk and voltage violation risk with respect to N-1 contingencies are minimized, and inequality constraints in the normal state are satisfied with a predefined probability level. Thus, the profitability and security can be balanced in the presence of stochastic REG. The proposed multiobjective OPF problem is solved by the multiobjective group search optimization and the two-point estimate method. Simulation results show that distribution network economy and postcontingency performance deteriorate with increased penetration level of REG, and the penetration level has a greater impact than the forecast errors of REG.},

abstract = {Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to constraints is a challenging is a challenging problem that arises in many control applications including controller design, realization theory and model reduction. This class of optimization problems, known as rank minimization, is NP-HARD, and for most practical problems there are no efficient algorithms that yield exact solutions. A popular heuristic algorithm replaces the rank function with the nuclear norm-equal to the sum of the singular values-of the decision variable. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition that quantifies when this heuristic successfully finds the minimum rank solution of a linear constraint set. We further show that most of the problems of interest in control can be formulated as rank minimization subject to such linear constraints. We additionally provide a probability distribution over instances of the affine rank minimization problem such that instances sampled from this distribution satisfy our conditions for success with overwhelming probability provided the number of constraints is appropriately large. Finally, we give empirical evidence that these probabilistic bounds provide accurate predictions of the heuristic¿s performance in non-asymptotic scenarios.},

abstract = {—State Estimation is an essential technique to pro-vide observability in power systems. Traditionally developed for high-voltage transmission networks, state estimation requires equipping networks with many real-time sensors, which remains a challenge at the scale of distribution networks. This paper proposes a method to complement a limited set of real-time measurements with voltage predictions from forecast models. The method differs from the classical weighted least-squares approach, and instead relies on Bayesian estimation formulated as a linear least squares estimation problem. We integrate recently developed linear models for unbalanced 3-phase power flow to construct voltage predictions as a linear mapping of load predictions. The estimation step is a linear computation allowing high resolution state estimate updates, for instance by exploiting a small set of phasor measurement units. Uncertainties can be determined a priori and smoothed a posteriori, making the method useful for both planning, operation and post hoc analysis. The method is applied to an IEEE benchmark and on a real network testbed at the Dutch utility Alliander.},

Extension of wholesale high-voltage power markets to allow distribution network connected prosumers to participate, albeit desirable, has stalled on high transaction costs and the lack of a tractable market clearing framework. This paper presents a distributed, massively parallel architecture that enables tractable transmission and distribution locational marginal price (T{\&}DLMP) discovery along with optimal scheduling of centralized generation, decentralized conventional and flexible loads, and distributed energy resources (DERs). DERs include distributed generation; electric vehicle (EV) battery charging and storage; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) and combined heat {\&} power (CHP) microgenerators; computing; volt/var control devices; grid-friendly appliances; smart transformers; and more. The proposed iterative distributed architecture can discover T{\&}DLMPs while capturing the full complexity of each participating DER's intertemporal preferences and physical system dynamics.},

abstract = {The matrix low-rank approximation problem with additional convex constraints can find many applications and has been extensively studied before. However, this problem is shown to be nonconvex and NP-hard; most of the existing solutions are heuristic and application-dependent. In this paper, we show that, other than tons of application in current literature, this problem can be used to recover a feasible solution for SDP relaxation. By some sophisticated tricks, it can be equivalently posed in an appropriate form for the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve. The two updates of ADMM include the basic matrix low-rank approximation and projection onto a convex set. Different from the general non-convex problems, the sub-problems in each step of ADMM can be solved exactly and efficiently in spite of their non-convexity. Moreover, the algorithm will converge exponentially under proper conditions. The simulation results confirm its superiority over existing solutions. We believe that the results in this paper provide a useful tool for this important problem and will help to extend the application of ADMM to the non-convex regime.},

In this research, we have created a notation that makes the filtration process the central syntactic construction of the MSPR. As a result, we achieve lower redundancy and higher modularity than is possible using the mathematical notation commonly associated with stochastic programming. To experiment with our ideas, we have created StAMPL, a specialized modeling tool for the MSPR that is based on the AMPL modeling language. StAMPL implements our notation and converts models written in our notation to instances that can be solved using standard methods. Using this approach, we are able to represent models in a very clean, simple, and scalable format while maintaining almost all the power of the AMPL language.},

By integrating all of these results into the SDP model a new hybrid relaxation is proposed, which combines the benefits from all of these recent works. This strengthened SDP formulation is evaluated on 71 AC Optimal Power Flow test cases from the NESTA archive and is shown to have an optimality gap of less than 1{\%} on 63 cases. This new hybrid relaxation closes 50{\%} of the open cases considered, leaving only eight for future investigation.},

The traditional loss model is studied and a new model is proposed. The new model achieves more defendable and predictable market-clearing results by introducing loss distribution factors to explicitly balance the consumed losses in the lossless dc power system model. The distributed market slack reference is also introduced and discussed. The LMP components produced by the two models are studied and compared under changes in slack reference. Numerical examples are presented to further compare the two models.},

Unfortunately, despite significant attention from the research community, stochastic unit commitment solvers have not made their way into practice, due in large part to the computational difficulty of the problem. In this paper, we address this issue, and focus on the development of a decomposition scheme based on the progressive hedging algorithm of Rockafellar and Wets. Our focus is on achieving solve times that are consistent with the requirements of ISO and utilities, on modest-scale instances, using reasonable numbers of scenarios. Further, we make use of modest-scale parallel computing, representing capabilities either presently deployed, or easily deployed in the near future. We demonstrate our progress to date on a test instance representing a simplified version of the US western interconnect (WECC-240). View full abstract},

abstract = {Convex relaxations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems have attracted significant interest as in several instances they provably yield the global optima to the original non-convex problems. If the relaxation fails to be exact, the optimality gap is often small, i.e., the relaxation's objective function value is close to the objective value of the best known AC-feasible point. This work studies inexact solutions to the quadratic convex (QC) and semidefinite (SDP) relaxations, providing a comprehensive analysis on the resulting distances to both AC-feasibility and local optimality. To this end, we propose two empirical distance metrics which complement the optimality gap. In addition, we investigate two methods to recover AC-feasible solutions: penalization methods and warm-starting of non-convex solvers. For the PGLib OPF benchmarks, we show that i) despite an optimality gap of less than 1{\%}, several test cases still exhibit substantial distances to AC-feasibility and local optimality; ii) the optimality gaps do not strongly correlate with either distance. We also show that several existing penalization methods may fail to recover AC-feasible or near-globally optimal solutions and that benefits of warm-starting of local solvers strongly depend on test case and solver and are not correlated with the optimality gaps.},

These convex relaxations can be used for a number of important tasks, such as verifying that an image classification network is robust to adversarial inputs, or providing optimality guarantees for decision problems with machine learning models embedded inside (i.e. the `predict, then optimize' paradigm). Our convex relaxations arise from mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations, and so they can be paired with existing MIP technology to produce provably optimal primal solutions, or to further strengthen the relaxations via cutting planes. We provide convex relaxations for networks with many of the most popular nonlinear operations (e.g. ReLU and max pooling) that are strictly stronger than other approaches from the literature. We corroborate this computationally on image classification verification tasks on the MNIST digit data set, where we show that our relaxations are able to match the bound improvement provided by state-of-the-art MIP solvers, in orders of magnitude less time.},

abstract = {The ACOPF is at the core of competitive wholesale electricity markets and vertically integrated utility operations. The ACOPF simultaneously co-optimizes real and reactive power. First formulated over half a century ago in 1962 by Carpentier, the ACOPF is the most representative mathematical programming-based formulation of steady-state operations in AC networks. However the ACOPF is not solved in practice due to the nonconvex, nonlinear structure of the problem, for which finding the globally optimal solution is known to be NP-hard. Instead, least-cost unit commitment and generation dispatch in the day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time markets is determined with numerous simplifications of the ACOPF. This work presents a series of essays on the ACOPF problem, which include formulations, approximations, and applications in the electricity markets. The main themes center around ACOPF modeling fundamentals, followed by local and global solution methods to solve the problem for a variety of applications in the electricity markets. Original contributions of these essays include an alternative formulation of the ACOPF, a successive linear programming algorithm to solving the ACOPF for the real-time market, an outer approximation method to solving integrated ACOPF-unit commitment as a mixed-integer linear program for the day-ahead market, and applications of convex relaxations to the ACOPF and its approximations for the purpose of globally optimal storage integration. These contributions are concluded with a discussion of potential future directions of work.},

abstract = {In this paper, the overvoltage problems that might arise from the integration of photovoltaic (PV) panels into low-voltage (LV) distribution networks is addressed. A distributed scheme is proposed that adjusts the reactive and active power output of inverters to prevent or alleviate such problems. The proposed scheme is model-free and makes use of limited communication between the controllers in the form of a distress signal only during emergency conditions. It prioritizes the use of reactive power, while active power curtailment is performed only as a last resort. The behavior of the scheme is studied using dynamic simulations on a single LV feeder and on a larger network composed of 14 LV feeders. Its performance is compared with a centralized scheme based on the solution of an optimal power flow (OPF) problem, whose objective function is to minimize the active power curtailment. The proposed scheme successfully mitigates overvoltage situations due to high PV penetration and performs almost as well as the OPF-based solution with significantly less information and communication requirements.},

abstract = {Finding a global solution to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is difficult due to its nonconvexity. A convex relaxation in the form of semidefinite programming (SDP) has attracted much attention lately as it yields a global solution in several practical cases. However, it does not in all cases, and such cases have been documented in recent publications. This paper presents another SDP method known as the moment-sos (sum of squares) approach, which generates a sequence that converges towards a global solution to the OPF problem at the cost of higher runtime. Our finding is that in the small examples where the previously studied SDP method fails, this approach finds the global solution. The higher cost in runtime is due to an increase in the matrix size of the SDP problem, which can vary from one instance to another. Numerical experiment shows that the size is very often a quadratic function of the number of buses in the network, whereas it is a linear function of the number of buses in the case of the previously studied SDP method.},

abstract = {In this work, we develop an adaptive, multivariate partitioning algorithm for solving mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) with multi-linear terms to global optimality. This iterative algorithm primarily exploits the advantages of piecewise polyhedral relaxation approaches via disjunctive formulations to solve MINLPs to global optimality in contrast to the conventional spatial branch-and-bound approaches. In order to maintain relatively small-scale mixed-integer linear programs at every iteration of the algorithm, we adaptively partition the variable domains appearing in the multi-linear terms. We also provide proofs on convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm to a global solution. Further, we discuss a few algorithmic enhancements based on the sequential bound-tightening procedure as a presolve step, where we observe the importance of solving piecewise relaxations compared to basic convex relaxations to speed-up the convergence of the algorithm to global optimality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our disjunctive formulations and the algorithm on well-known benchmark problems (including Pooling and Blending instances) from MINLPLib and compare with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers. With this novel approach, we solve several large-scale instances which are, in some cases, intractable by the global optimization solver. We also shrink the best known optimality gap for one of the hard, generalized pooling problem instance.},

abstract = {A critical disadvantage of primal-dual interior-point methods against dual interiorpoint methods for large scale SDPs (semide nite programs) has been that the primal positive semide nite variable matrix becomes fully dense in general even when all data matrices are sparse. Based on some fundamental results about positive semide nite matrix completion, this article proposes a general method of exploiting the aggregate sparsity pattern over all data matrices to overcome this disadvantage. Our method is used in two ways. One is a conversion of a sparse SDP having a large scale positive semide nite variable matrix into an SDP having multiple but smaller size positive semide nite variable matrices to which we can e ectively apply any interior-point method for SDPs employing a standard block-diagonal matrix data structure. The other way is an incorporation of our method into primal-dual interior-point methods which we can apply directly to a given SDP. In Part II of this article, we will investigate an implementation of such a primal-dual interior-point method based on positive de nite matrix completion, and report some numerical results.},

abstract = {The implementation of optimal power flow (OPF) methods to perform voltage and power flow regulation in electric networks is generally believed to require communication. We consider distribution systems with multiple controllable Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and present a data-driven approach to learn control policies for each DER to reconstruct and mimic the solution to a centralized OPF problem from solely locally available information. Collectively, all local controllers closely match the centralized OPF solution, providing near-optimal performance and satisfaction of system constraints. A rate distortion framework facilitates the analysis of how well the resulting fully decentralized control policies are able to reconstruct the OPF solution. Our methodology provides a natural extension to decide what buses a DER should communicate with to improve the reconstruction of its individual policy. The method is applied on both single- and three-phase test feeder networks using data from real loads and distributed generators. It provides a framework for Distribution System Operators to efficiently plan and operate the contributions of DERs to active distribution networks.},

abstract = {Coal was central to the industrial revolution, but in the 20th century it increasingly was superseded by oil and gas. However, in recent years coal again has become the predominant source of global carbon emissions. We show that this trend of rapidly increasing coal-based emissions is not restricted to a few individual countries such as China. Rather, we are witnessing a global renaissance of coal majorly driven by poor, fast-growing countries that increasingly rely on coal to satisfy their growing energy demand. The low price of coal relative to gas and oil has played an important role in accelerating coal consumption since the end of the 1990s. In this article, we show that in the increasingly integrated global coal market the availability of a domestic coal resource does not have a statistically significant impact on the use of coal and related emissions. These findings have important implications for climate change mitigation: If future economic growth of poor countries is fueled mainly by coal, ambitious mitigation targets very likely will become infeasible. Building new coal power plant capacities will lead to lock-in effects for the next few decades. If that lock-in is to be avoided, international climate policy must find ways to offer viable alternatives to coal for developing countries.},

abstract = {In the framework of approaches which question the narrow scope of the deterministic N-1 security criterion, this work proposes an enhanced risk-based AC security-constrained optimal power flow (RB-SCOPF) problem formulation to aid transmission system operators (TSOs) trading-off economy and (thermal) security. The system security is controlled through an overall system risk constraint, which accumulates the individual risk related to each contingency, defined as the product between the probability of contingency occurrence and the contingency severity. The latter is expressed in terms of the amount of voluntary load shedding which, complementary to conventional corrective actions, is able to correct violation of post-contingency long-term thermal limits. The existing RB-SCOPF formulations are enhanced with short-term thermal post-contingency limits, aimed at avoiding cascade line tripping, and TSO operating rule. The main features of the RB-SCOPF formulation are illustrated in the IEEE 118-bus system.},

The negotiations there will be based on national pledges, formally known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, with the goal of setting the world on a sustainable path. The International Energy Agency has long emphasised to its members and the world at large that energy production and use which is not compatible with international environmental requirements is not sustainable: it fails the test of energy security. The IEA, therefore, feels an obligation to make a contribution to COP21 – a contribution which reconciles climate and energy needs. That is the purpose of this special report in the World Energy Outlook series. The report: Presents a detailed first assessment of the energy sector impact of known and signalled national climate pledges for COP21. Proposes a bridging strategy to deliver a near-term peak in global energy-related greenhouse-gas emissions, based on five pragmatic measures that can advance climate goals through the energy sector without blunting economic growth. Highlights the urgent need to accelerate the development of emerging technologies that are, ultimately, essential to transforming the global energy system into one that is consistent with the world's climate goals. Recommends four key pillars on which COP21 can build success, from an energy sector perspective.},

abstract = {The deployment of energy storage systems (ESSs) is a significant avenue for maximising the energy efficiency of a distribution network, and overall network performance can be enhanced by their optimal placement, sizing, and operation. An optimally sized and placed ESS can facilitate peak energy demand fulfilment, enhance the benefits from the integration of renewables and distributed energy sources, aid power quality management, and reduce distribution network expansion costs. This paper provides an overview of optimal ESS placement, sizing, and operation. It considers a range of grid scenarios, targeted performance objectives, applied strategies, ESS types, and advantages and limitations of the proposed systems and approaches. While batteries are widely used as ESSs in various applications, the detailed comparative analysis of ESS technical characteristics suggests that flywheel energy storage (FES) also warrants consideration in some distribution network scenarios. This research provides recommendations for related requirements or procedures, appropriate ESS selection, smart ESS charging and discharging, ESS sizing, placement and operation, and power quality issues. Furthermore, this study identifies future research opportunities in relation to challenges for optimal ESS placement planning, development and implementation issues, optimisation techniques, social impacts, and energy security.},

abstract = {With increasing level of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) penetration into low voltage (LV) distribution networks, analysis with realistic network models is necessary for adequate capturing of network behavior. Traditional three-phase 3-wire power flow approach lacks the capability of exact analysis of 4-wire multigrounded LV networks due to the approximation of merging the neutral wire admittance into the phase wire admittances. Such an approximation may not be desirable when neutral wire and grounding effects need to be assessed, especially in the presence of single-phase solar power injection that may cause a significant level of network unbalance. This paper proposes a three-phase power flow approach for distribution networks while preserving the original 3-wire and 4-wire configurations for more accurate estimation of rooftop PV impacts on different phases and neutrals. A three-phase transformer model is developed to interface between the 3-wire medium voltage (MV) and the 4-wire LV networks. Also an integrated network model is developed for an explicit representation of different phases, neutral wires and groundings of a distribution system. A series of power flow calculations have been performed using the proposed approach to investigate the impacts of single-phase variable PV generation on an Australian distribution system and results are presented.},

abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) energy consumption is variable and dependent on a number of external factors such as road topology, traffic, driving style, ambient temperature, etc. The goal of this paper is to detect and quantify correlations between the kinematic parameters of the vehicle and its energy consumption. Real-world data of EV energy consumption are used to construct the energy consumption calculation models. Based on the vehicle dynamics equation as underlying physical model, multiple linear regression is used to construct three models. Each model uses a different level of aggregation of the input parameters, allowing predictions using different types of available input parameters. One model uses aggregated values of the kinematic parameters of trips. This model allows prediction with basic, easily available input parameters such as travel distance, travel time, and temperature. The second model extends this by including detailed acceleration data. The third model uses the raw data of the kinematic parameters as input parameters to predict the energy consumption. Using detailed values of kinematic parameters for the prediction in theory increases the link between the statistical model and its underlying physical principles, but requires these parameters to be available as input in order to make predictions. The first two models show similar results. The third model shows a worse fit than the first two, but has a similar accuracy. This model has great potential for future improvement.},

abstract = {The availability of high-fidelity energy networks brings significant value to academic and commercial research. However, such releases also raise fundamental concerns related to privacy and security as they can reveal sensitive commercial information and expose system vulnerabilities. This paper investigates how to release power networks where the parameters of transmission lines and transformers are obfuscated. It does so by using the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), that provides strong privacy guarantees and has attracted significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately, simple DP mechanisms often result in AC-infeasible networks. To address these concerns, this paper presents a novel differential privacy mechanism that guarantees AC-feasibility and largely preserves the fidelity of the obfuscated network. Experimental results also show that the obfuscation significantly reduces the potential damage of an attacker exploiting the release of the dataset.},

abstract = {The output of renewable energy fluctuates significantly depending on weather conditions. We develop a unit commitment model to analyze requirements of the forecast output and its error for renewable energies. Our model obtains the time series for the operational state of thermal power plants that would maximize the profits of an electric power utility by taking into account both the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response of consumers. We consider a power system consisting of thermal power plants, photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The increase in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the substitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the number of operating thermal power plants is reduced by the demand response. A power utility has to continue thermal power plants for ensuring supply-demand balance; some of these plants can be decommissioned after installing a large number of wind farms or PV systems, if the demand response is applied using an appropriate price structure.},

abstract = {An exact three-phase fast decoupled power flow solution is introduced in this paper. This method uses traditional Newton-Raphson algorithm in a rectangular ccoordinate system. The Jacobian matrix of the proposed method can be decoupled both on phases as well as on real and imagnary parts. In addltion, the memoq requirement of the traditional fast decoupled load flow can be reduced to only one-sixth. The need of the complicated mutual coupling terms can be avoided. It is even possible to solve the distribution system with line conductances only. That is, an exact three-phase distribution load-flow program can be executed with minimum data preparation to substantially offload the burden of dlstribution engineers. Tests have shown 10 to 100 times performance than other methods for test systems with 45 to 270 buses.},

abstract = {Consider a weighted and undirected graph, possibly with self-loops, and its corresponding Laplacian matrix, possibly augmented with additional diagonal elements corresponding to the self-loops. The Kron reduction of this graph is again a graph whose Laplacian matrix is obtained by the Schur complement of the original Laplacian matrix with respect to a subset of nodes. The Kron reduction process is ubiquitous in classic circuit theory and in related disciplines such as electrical impedance tomography, smart grid monitoring, transient stability assessment in power networks, or analysis and simulation of induction motors and power electronics. More general applications of Kron reduction occur in sparse matrix algorithms, multi-grid solvers, finite--element analysis, and Markov chains. The Schur complement of a Laplacian matrix and related concepts have also been studied under different names and as purely theoretic problems in the literature on linear algebra. In this paper we propose a general graph-theoretic framework for Kron reduction that leads to novel and deep insights both on the mathematical and the physical side. We show the applicability of our framework to various practical problem setups arising in engineering applications and computation. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and detailed graph-theoretic analysis of the Kron reduction process encompassing topological, algebraic, spectral, resistive, and sensitivity analyses. Throughout our theoretic elaborations we especially emphasize the practical applicability of our results.},

The solution algorithm is based on mathematical programming decomposition techniques that allow the iterative solution of a "base-case" economic dispatch and separate contingency analysis with generation rescheduling to eliminate constraint violations. The resulting dispatch has the same security level as the usual security-constrained dispatch, but with lower operating costs. Case studies with the IEEE 118-bus are presented. The extension of the methodology to the probabilistic case will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.},

abstract = {A detailed processing cost breakdown is given for lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes, which focuses on: 1) elimination of toxic, costly N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) dispersion chemistry; 2) doubling the thicknesses of the anode and cathode to raise energy density; and 3) reduction of the anode electrolyte wetting and SEI-layer formation time. These processing cost reduction technologies generically adaptable to any anode or cathode cell chemistry and are being implemented at ORNL. This paper shows step by step how these cost savings can be realized in existing or new LIB manufacturing plants using a baseline case of thin (power) electrodes produced with NMP processing and a standard 10-14-day wetting and formation process. In particular, it is shown that aqueous electrode processing can cut the electrode processing cost and energy consumption by an order of magnitude. Doubling the thickness of the electrodes allows for using half of the inactive current collectors and separators, contributing even further to the processing cost savings. Finally wetting and SEI-layer formation cost savings are discussed in the context of a protocol with significantly reduced time. These three benefits collectively offer the possibility of reducing LIB pack cost from {\$}502.8 kW h-1-usable to {\$}370.3 kW h-1-usable, a savings of {\$}132.5/kWh (or 26.4{\%}).},

It proposes an affinely adjustable robust OPF formulation where the base-point generation is calculated to serve the forecast load which is not balanced by RESs, and the generation control through participation factors ensures a feasible solution for all realizations of RES output within a prescribed uncertainty set. The adjustable robust OPF framework is solved using quadratic programming with successive constraint enforcement and can coordinate the computation of both the base-point generation and participation factors. Numerical results on standard test networks reveal a relatively small increase in the expected operational cost as the uncertainty level increases. In addition, solutions of networks that include both uncertain wind generation and Gaussian distributed demand are shown to have less cost and a higher level of robustness as compared to those from a recent robust scheduling method.},

The goal is to produce a generation schedule which has a minimal number of post-contingency corrections as well as a minimal amount of total MW rescheduled. In other words, the new SCOPF model effectively clears contingencies with corrective actions that have a minimal impact on system operations. The proposed SCOPF model utilizes sparse optimization techniques to achieve computational tractability for large-scale power systems. We also propose two efficient decomposition algorithms. Extensive computational experiments show the advantage of the proposed model and algorithms on several standard IEEE test systems and large-scale real-world power systems.},

These kinds of distribution transformers are commonly used in distribution systems to supply single-phase lighting loads and three-phase power appliances simultaneously. Using the proposed models, along with appropriate three-phase power flow programs, the inherent characteristics of distribution transformers can be retrieved correctly. The major considerations involve copper loss, core losses, phase angular displacement between primary and secondary voltages and off-nominal tapping of the transformers. Based on the proposed models, three distribution transformers with unbalanced loads are analyzed in detail in this paper.

abstract = {The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is nonconvex and generally hard to solve. In this paper,we propose a semidefinite programming (SDP) optimization, which is the dual of an equivalent form of the OPF problem. A global optimum solution to the OPF problem can be retrieved from a solution of this convex dual problem whenever the duality gap is zero. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided in this paper to guarantee the existence of no duality gap for the OPF problem. This condition is satisfied by the standard IEEE benchmark systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses as well as several randomly generated systems. Since this condition is hard to study, a sufficient zero-duality-gap condition is also derived. This sufficient condition holds for IEEE systems after small resistance ( per unit) is added to every transformer that originally assumes zero resistance. We investigate this sufficient condition and justify that it holds widely in practice. The main underlying reason for the successful convexification of the OPF problem can be traced back to the modeling of transformers and transmission lines as well as the non-negativity of physical quantities such as resistance and inductance.},

abstract = {The standard way to represent a choice between n alternatives in Mixed Integer Programming is through n binary variables that add up to one. Unfortunately, this approach commonly leads to unbalanced branch-and-bound trees and diminished solver performance. In this paper, we present an encoding formulation framework that encompasses and expands existing approaches to mitigate this behavior. Through this framework, we generalize the incremental formulation for piecewise linear functions to any finite union of polyhedra with identical recession cones. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {IEEE We compute an optimal day-ahead dispatch plan for distribution networks with stochastic resources and batteries, while accounting for grid and battery losses. We formulate and solve a scenario-based AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), which is by construction non-convex. We explain why the existing relaxation methods do not apply and we propose a novel iterative scheme, Corrected DistFlow (CoDistFlow), to solve the scenariobased AC OPF problem in radial networks. It uses a modified branch flow model for radial networks with angle relaxation that accounts for line shunt capacitances. At each step, it solves a convex problem based on a modified DistFlow OPF with correction terms for line losses and node voltages. Then, it updates the correction terms using the results of a full load flow. We prove that under a mild condition, a fixed point of CoDistFlow provides an exact solution to the full AC power flow equations. We propose treating battery losses similarly to grid losses by using a single-port electrical equivalent instead of battery efficiencies. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in a simple and real electrical networks. We conclude that grid and battery losses affect the feasibility of the dayahead dispatch plan and show how CoDistFlow can handle them correctly.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the need for the integration of storage systems on transmission networks having renewable sources, and presents a tool for energy storage planning. The tool employs robust optimization to minimize the investment in storage units that guarantee a feasible system operation, without load or renewable power curtailment, for all scenarios in the convex hull of a discrete uncertainty set; it is termed ROSION—Robust Optimization of Storage Investment On Networks. The computational engine in ROSION is a specific tailored implementation of a column-and-constraint generation algorithm for two-stage robust optimization problems, where a lower and an upper bound on the optimal objective function value are successively calculated until convergence. The lower bound is computed using mixed-integer linear programming and the upper bound via linear programming applied to a sequence of similar problems. ROSION is demonstrated for storage planning on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus networks, and the robustness of the designs is validated via Monte Carlo simulation.},

abstract = {We study mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) that are driven by a collection of indicator variables where each indicator variable controls a subset of the decision variables. An indicator variable, when it is "turned off", forces some of the decision variables to assume a fixed value, and, when it is "turned on", forces them to belong to a convex set. Most of the integer variables in known MINLP problems are of this type. We first study a mixed integer set defined by a single separable quadratic constraint and a collection of variable upper and lower bound constraints. This is an interesting set that appears as a substructure in many applications. We present the convex hull description of this set. We then extend this to produce an explicit characterization of the convex hull of the union of a point and a bounded convex set defined by analytic functions. Further, we show that for many classes of problems, the convex hull can be expressed via conic quadratic constraints, and thus relaxations can be solved via second-order cone programming. Our work is closely related with the earlier work of Ceria and Soares (1996) as well as recent work by Frangioni and Gentile (2006) and, Akt{\~{A}}¼rk, Atamt{\~{A}}¼rk and G{\~{A}}¼rel (2007). Finally, we apply our results to develop tight formulations of mixed integer nonlinear programs in which the nonlinear functions are separable and convex and in which indicator variables play an important role. In particular, we present strong computational results with two applications - quadratic facility location and network design with congestion - that show the power of the reformulation technique. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Thenuclear norm (sum of singular values) of a matrix isoften used in convex heuristics for rank minimization problems incontrol, signal processing, and statistics. Such heuristics can be viewedas extensions of ell1-norm minimization techniques for cardinality minimization andsparse signal estimation. In this paper we consider the problemof minimizing the nuclear norm of an affine matrix-valued function.This problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program, butthe reformulation requires large auxiliary matrix variables, and is expensiveto solve by general-purpose interior-point solvers. We show that problemstructure in the semidefinite programming formulation can be exploited todevelop more efficient implementations of interior-point methods. In the fastimplementation, the cost per iteration is reduced to a quarticfunction of the problem dimensions and is comparable to thecost of solving the approximation problem in the Frobenius norm.In the second part of the paper, the nuclear normapproximation algorithm is applied to system identification. A variant ofa simple subspace algorithm is presented in which low-rank matrixapproximations are computed via nuclear norm minimization instead of thesingular value decomposition. This has the important advantage of preservinglinear matrix structure in the low-rank approximation. The method isshown to perform well on publicly available benchmark data. 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},

abstract = {The US electric power system has undergone substantial change since the late 1980's and promises to continue to change into the foreseeable future. The changes began in 1989 with the restructuring of the way industry procured electric supply. The restructuring sought to replace centralized decision‐making by the traditional vertically integrated utility with decentralized decision‐making by market participants that establish prices through market forces, not regulation. Today, that transformation is still in progress. Vertically integrated firms continue to serve customers in regions of the country. A sustainable means for ensuring adequate transmission has not been demonstrated. And the demand side of the equation is not able to compete fully in an open market environment. In the midst of this restructuring, advances in electric transportation, a greater awareness of the environmental effects of electricity production, and a desire on the part of the US to eliminate its dependence on foreign oil has prompted a movement to again re‐invent the electric system. The new objectives include better accommodation of planning and operational uncertainty, especially that associated with variable renewable generation sources such as wind and solar, accommodation of major reductions in CO2 and other pollutants harmful to air quality, and economic and reliable operation of existing assets with less margin than in the past. It is now agreed that the “smart grid” that will be needed to achieve these objectives will involve the confluence of new sensing, communication, control, and computing as a unique blend of technologies that must be designed specifically to manage the requirements for a future electric power system based on competitive markets. Fundamental to this agreement is the idea that significant advances are needed in the areas of large‐scale computation, modeling, and data handling.},

In this paper, we classify the local minima of LRSDPr and prove the optimal convergence of a slight variant of the successful, yet experimental, algorithm of Burer and Monteiro [6], which handles LRSDPr via the nonconvex change of variables X = RR T. In addition, for particular problem classes, we describe a practical technique for obtaining lower bounds on the optimal solution value during the execution of the algorithm. Computational results are presented on a set of combinatorial optimization relaxations, including some of the largest quadratic assignment SDPs solved to date.},

abstract = {Electricity storage plants can be used for many applications, with one of the most studied applications being arbitrage in the day-ahead market. Although the arbitrage value is related to the presence of price spreads, it also depends on the effect of (dis)charge actions on prices, as arbitrage generally reduces price spreads by increasing off-peak prices when charging and decreasing peak prices when discharging. As such, there are two important assumptions in price-based unit commitment arbitrage models: first, whether the storage operator is assumed to have perfect knowledge of future prices, and second, whether they recognize that their (dis)charge actions may affect those prices, i.e., the price-taking or price-making assumption. This article proposes a comprehensive formulation of the arbitrage problem including detailed operating constraints, and focuses on relaxing the price-taking assumption by considering real-world price-effect data, published in the form of hourly piecewise linear relationships between quantity and price based on submitted bids, which are referred to as "market resilience functions". These can be used to (1) evaluate the price-taking and price-making assumptions based on simplified price-effects, and to (2) provide an upper limit to the arbitrage value under the assumption that prices and price-effects are known at the decision stage. In addition, a stepwise approximation to the piecewise linear functions is developed to reduce computation time, i.e., from mixed-integer nonconvex quadratic programming to mixed-integer linear programming, while providing lower- and upper bound approximations to the arbitrage value. The developed models are applied to the Belgian day-ahead market for 2014, and show that the price-effect has a strong impact on the operation and arbitrage value of large-scale storage.},

@article{Fischetti2016a,
abstract = {Benders is one of the most famous decomposition tools for Mathematical Programming, and it is the method of choice e.g., in mixed-integer stochastic programming. Its hallmark is the capability of decomposing certain types of models into smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved individually to produce local information (notably, cutting planes) to be exploited by a centralized "master" problem. As its name suggests, the power of the technique comes essentially from the decomposition effect, i.e., the separability of the problem into a master problem and several smaller subproblems. In this paper we address the question of whether the Benders approach can be useful even without separability of the subproblem, i.e., when its application yields a single subproblem of the same size as the original problem. In particular, we focus on the capacitated facility location problem, in two variants: the classical linear case, and a "congested" case where the objective function contains convex but non-separable quadratic terms. We show how to embed the Benders approach within a modern branch-and-cut mixed-integer programming solver, addressing explicitly all the ingredients that are instrumental for its success. In particular, we discuss some computational aspects that are related to the negative effects derived from the lack of separability. Extensive computational results on various classes of instances from the literature are reported, with a comparison with the state-of-the-art exact and heuristic algorithms. The outcome is that a clever but simple implementation of the Benders approach can be very effective even without separability, as its performance is comparable and sometimes even better than that of the most effective and sophisticated algorithms proposed in the previous literature.},

As climate change mitigation and economic concerns drive a sustained transformation of the energy sector, transparent and well-founded analyses are more important than ever. We assert that models and their associated data must be openly available to facilitate higher quality science, greater productivity through less duplicated effort, and a more effective science-policy boundary. There are also valid reasons why data and code are not open: ethical and security concerns, unwanted exposure, additional workload, and institutional or personal inertia. Overall, energy policy research ostensibly lags behind other fields in promoting more open and reproducible science. We take stock of the status quo and propose actionable steps forward for the energy research community to ensure that it can better engage with decision-makers and continues to deliver robust policy advice in a transparent and reproducible way.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective.What distin- guishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the al- gorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book,we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

A reformulation of a mathematical program P is a mathematical program Q obtained from P via symbolic transformations applied to the sets of variables, objectives and constraints. We present a survey of existing reformulations interpreted along these lines, some example applications, and describe the implementation of a software framework for reformulation and optimization.},

abstract = {—Power flow analysis is one of the tools that is required in most of the distribution system studies. An important charac- teristic of distribution systems is the load unbalance in the phases and a three-phase power flow analysis is needed. In this paper, a three-phase linear power flow (3LPF) formulation is derived based on the fact that in a typical distribution system, voltage angles and magnitudes vary within relatively narrow boundaries. The accu- racy of the proposed 3LPF is verified using several test cases. Po- tential applications of the proposedmethod are in distribution sys- tems state estimation and volt-VAR optimization.},

abstract = {Within the context of ancillary services for Active Distribution Networks (ADNs), application of intelligent control techniques is required in order to achieve specific operation objectives. Despite their differences, most control mechanisms proposed in the literature rely on the assumption that the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) has an accurate and up- to-date model of the network topology and a complete knowledge of the line parameters, i.e., a correct network admittance matrix Y. However, this assumption does not always hold in reality due to both an incomplete knowledge of the grid asset and /or a physical change of the line parameters. In this work, we consider the problem of optimal voltage control in ADNs under uncertain, but bounded, line parameters with no assumptions on the parameters' uncertainty distribution. In particular, availability of a monitoring infrastructure is assumed and the goal is to control the active and reactive power injections of a number of distributed generators connected to the network buses in coordination with the transformers on-load tap changers (OLTC). The optimal control problem is formulated as a mixed- integer linear problem by means of sensitivity coefficients and a robust optimization framework is used in order to account for the uncertainties in the network admittance matrix. In order to estimate the benefits of the proposed method, the evaluation of the algorithm is carried out by using both the IEEE 13-and the IEEE 34-nodes test feeder. Index},

abstract = {Optimally combining frequency control with self-consumption can increase revenues from battery storage systems installed behind-the-meter. This work presents an optimized control strategy that allows a battery to be used simultaneously for self-consumption and primary frequency control. Therein, it addresses two stochastic problems: the delivery of primary frequency control with a battery and the use of the battery for self-consumption. We propose a linear recharging policy to regulate the state of charge of the battery while providing primary frequency control. Formulating this as a chance-constrained problem, we can ensure that the risk of battery constraint violations stays below a predefined probability. We use robust optimization as a safe approximation to the chance-constraints, which allows to make the risk of constraint violation arbitrarily low, while keeping the problem tractable and offering maximum reserve capacity. Simulations with real frequency measurements prove the effectiveness of the designed recharging strategy. We adopt a rule-based policy for self-consumption, which is optimized using stochastic programming. This policy allows to reserve more energy and power of the battery on moments when expected consumption or production is higher, while using other moments for recharging from primary frequency control. We show that optimally combining the two services increases value from batteries significantly.},

abstract = {The analysis of electromagnetic transients has traditionally been discussed under the umbrella of circuit theory, the main core course in the electrical engineering curriculum, and therefore the subject of very many textbooks. However, some of the special characteristics of power plant components, such as machine non-linearities and transmission line frequency dependence, have not been adequately covered in conventional circuit theory. Among the specialist books written to try and remedy the situation are H. A. Peterson's Transient performance in power systems (1951) and A. Greenwood's Electric transients in power systems (1971). The former described the use of the transient network analyser to study the behaviour of linear and nonlinear power networks. The latter described the fundamental concepts of the subject and provided many examples of transient simulation based on the Laplace transform. By the mid-1960s the digital computer began to determine the future pattern of power system transients simulation. In 1976 the IEE published an important monograph, Computation of power system transients, based on pioneering computer simulation work carried out in the UK by engineers and mathematicians.},

This work demonstrates that convex relaxations of the AC-MLS problem provide a reliable and scalable method for finding high-quality bounds on the amount of active power load shedding required in the AC-MLS problem. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the solution methods proposed in this work are rigorously evaluated on 1000 {\$}N{\$}-{\$}k{\$} scenarios on seven power networks ranging in size from 70 to 6000 buses. The most effective relaxation of the AC-MLS problem converges in less than 20 seconds on commodity computing hardware for all 7000 of the scenarios considered.},

abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

This paper analyses the use of residential lead–acid energy storage coupled with photovoltaics and its possible interaction with the grid for different limits of feed-in power without any support policies. In the literature, these subjects are often treated independently and for very specific, non-optimised cases, thus motivating further research. Results show that reaching self-sufficiency values up to 40{\%} is possible, close to grid parity values, and only with photovoltaics. Beyond 40{\%}, energy storage must be used, strongly raising the cost of the electricity consumed and therefore the need for support policies for widespread adoption. Also, peak power consumption from the grid remains constant and load variability rises, suggesting that an increase in self-sufficiency would be accompanied by lower utilisation factors of power plants and, consequently, higher wholesale electricity prices during no sunshine hours. Limiting feed-in power attenuates the increased load variability and only slightly affects the economic viability of such installations. These results present a novel optimisation tool for developers and should be considered in future studies of distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as in energy policy.},

@article{Mou2015,
abstract = {—Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are expected to become widespread in the near future. However, high pene-tration of PHEVs can overload the distribution system. In smart grid, the charging of PHEVs can be controlled to reduce the peak load, known as demand-side management (DSM). In this paper, we focus on the DSM for PHEV charging at low-voltage transformers (LVTs). The objective is to flatten the load curve of LVTs, while satisfying each consumer's requirement for their PHEV to be charged to the required level by the specified time. We first formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem and then propose a decentralized water-filling-based algorithm to solve it. A moving horizon approach is utilized to handle the random arrival of PHEVs and the inaccuracy of the forecast nonPHEV load. We focus on decentralized solutions so that computational load can be shared by individ-ual PHEV chargers and the algorithm is scalable. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Index Terms—Decentralized convex optimization, demand-side management (DSM), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), smart grid, water filling.},

abstract = {In semidefinite programming, one minimizes a linear function subject to the constraint that an affine combination of symmetric matrices is positive semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are convex optimization problems. semidefinite programming unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial optimization.Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice. This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primaldual interior-point methods for their solution.},

abstract = {The corporate market is embracing free, "open source" software, as evidenced by the success of the technologies underlying LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software. The truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail. To help you beat the odds, Karl Fogel put together this guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal. Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level. * Money raised from the sale of this book supports the development of free software and documentation. About the Author In 1995, Karl Fogel co-founded Cyclic Software, a company offering commercial CVS support. In 1999 he added support for CVS anonymous read-only repository access, inaugurating a new standard for access to development sources in open source projects. That same year, he wrote "Open Source Development With CVS" (published by Coriolis), now in its third edition via Paraglyph Press. Since early 2000, he has worked for CollabNet, Inc, managing the creation and development of Subversion, a version control system written from scratch by CollabNet and a team of open source volunteers, and meant to replace CVS as the de facto standard among open source projects. He also participates in various other open source projects as a module maintainer, patch contributor, and documentation writer.},

The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar M learn how to create graphical "poems." Supplemental materials are available online.},

abstract = {The GB electricity system is evolving in pursuit of decarbonisation, with significant penetrations of autonomous wind and solar generation anticipated. Increased flexibility is needed by the GB system operator (National Grid) to manage the unpredictability and variability of intermittent generation and deliver system stability. In this context, electricity storage has a potentially important role to play as a source of flexibility in the future capacity mix. Electricity storage is a diverse concept, encompassing a broad range of technologies with varied potential applications. This means that the business case for distribution connected storage is typically multi-layered, with several distinct components in the value stream, typically involving multiple parties. The feasibility of the business case is influenced by the legal and regulatory framework. But, the existing framework currently presents several issues for increased deployment of electricity storage within the GB market. These issues are summarised below, along with our recommendations from the report, which would help the potential benefits of electricity storage to the system to be realised.},

abstract = {The development of exploratory visualization tools based on coordinated multiple views has become an important area of information visualization research. One goal of this research is to allow users to explore their data by switching freely between building and browsing in a flexible, integrated, interactive graphical environment that requires minimal programming skill to use. However, the range of possibilities for displaying data across multiple views depends on the flexibility of coordination, the expressiveness of visual abstraction, and the ability of users to comprehend the structure of their visualizations as they work. As a result, data exploration has been limited in practice to a small subset of visualizations that are both useful and usable. This dissertation describes four primary contributions to the field of information visualization. The first contribution is a conceptual model of multiple view coordination, Live Properties, in which views tightly couple through shared objects that describe the navigation and selection state of a visualization. The second contribution is a visual abstraction language, Coordinated Queries, loosely based on the relational data model. Views aggregate, filter, sort, and graphically encode data records using declarative expressions that can be defined in terms of interactive parameters. The third contribution is a conceptual model of metavisualization , in which the interactive structure of coordinated visualizations can be explored by visualizing it in situ, directly in the running visualizations themselves. The fourth contribution is Improvise, an implemented system in which users build and browse multiview visualizations interactively using Live Properties and Coordinated Queries. By coupling visual abstraction with coordination, users gain precise control over how navigation and selection in a visualization affects the appearance of data in individual views. In the Improvise user interface, users can create and modify visualizations quickly and incrementally during data exploration, optionally using metavisualization to explore interactive structure as it evolves. As a result, it is practical to build visualizations with many more views and much richer coordination in Improvise than in other exploratory visualization environments.},

abstract = {Smart Grid schemes in which multiple network elements and participants are managed for the benefit of the distribution network (e.g., energy loss reduction, restoration, etc.) require sophisticated algorithms to control them in the most suitable manner while catering for network constraints. Such a complex decision making process can be solved by tailoring the AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem to the corresponding Smart Grid scheme. Non-linear programming AC OPF formulations, however, can suffer from scalability and robustness issues which in turn might limit their adoption. Here, a novel quadratic programming formulation is proposed and compared against the non-linear, quadratically constrained and linearized approaches. Two cases are carried out to assess their performance: (1) management of distributed generation units to maximize renewable energy harvesting (continuous control variables); and, (2) control of capacitors to minimize energy losses (discrete control variables). The results demonstrate that the proposed quadratic approach significantly outperforms the more conventional formulations in both computational efficiency and robustness. This makes it a suitable alternative to be at the heart of the decision making of complex, real-time schemes to be adopted by future Smart distribution networks. CCBY},

The method is applied to a near-future scenario, based on a real residential feeder. The results provide insight into the dimensioning and the required specifications of the battery and the inverter. It is found that an inverter without batteries already achieves part of the objectives. Therefore, the added value of batteries to an inverter is discussed. Furthermore, a comparison between lithium-ion and lead-acid battery technologies is presented. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

We propose an alternative mixed integer linear disjunctive formulation, which has better conditioning properties than the standard disjunctive model. The mixed integer program is solved by a commercial branch and bound code, where an upper bound provided by a heuristic solution is used to reduce the tree search. The heuristic solution is obtained using a GRASP metaheuristic, capable of finding sub-optimal solutions with an affordable computing effort. Combining the upper bound given by the heuristic and the mixed integer disjunctive model, optimality can be proven for several hard problem instances},

abstract = {Higher shares of electricity generation from renewable energy sources and market liberalization is increasing uncertainty in power systems operation. At the same time, operation is becoming more flexible with improved control systems and new technology such as phase shifting transformers (PSTs) and high voltage direct current connections (HVDC). Previous studies have shown that the use of corrective control in response to outages contributes to a reduction in operating cost, while maintaining N-1 security. In this work, we propose a method to extend the use of corrective control of PSTs and HVDCs to react to uncertainty. We characterize the uncertainty as continuous random variables, and define the corrective control actions through affine control policies. This allows us to efficiently model control reactions to a large number of uncertainty sources. The control policies are then included in a chance constrained optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that the system constraints are enforced with a desired probability. By applying an analytical reformulation of the chance constraints, we obtain a second-order cone problem for which we develop an efficient solution algorithm. In a case study for the IEEE 118 bus system, we show that corrective control for uncertainty leads to a decrease in operational cost, while maintaining system security. Further, we demonstrate the scalability of the method by solving the problem for the IEEE 300 bus and the Polish system test cases.},

@article{Ulinuha2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} IEOM Society International. The extensive and ever increasing application of nonlinear loads have introduced power quality problem in distribution system. The nonlinear relation between voltage and current may cause harmonic currents that propagate through the distribution network causing voltage distortion. The presence of higher frequency components in the distorted voltage may lead to a possible dangerous resonance and significant voltage increment that can be destructive. The higher frequency components of the voltage may be suppressed using filter and the distortion may then be mitigated. For the purpose of analyzing the system including nonlinear loads and the related voltage distortions, a harmonic power flow calculation is developed. A relatively fast and accurate approach for harmonic analyses using decoupled technique is proposed. The system with a number of harmonic generating devices may be analyzed and a number of passive filters are then installed to alleviate the distortion assuring the compliant to the IEEE 519 Standard. The size and location of the filters are tentatively determined and the system improvement is observed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is implemented on a 123-bus IEEE distribution system including a number of nonlinear loads. The capability of the decouple approach accepting measurement results may lead to real implementation. {\textcopyright} IEOM Society International.},

We establish a global convergence rate for such a scheme from any initial point to a stationary point of the problem while using an exact penalty formulation to gain numerical robustness against ill-conditioning. We compare our algorithm with a well-established solver, IPOPT, on several representative problem instances in MATPOWER.

abstract = {This paper develops a strategy to coordinate the charging of autonomous plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) using concepts from non-cooperative games. The foundation of the paper is a model that assumes PEVs are cost-minimizing and weakly coupled via a common electricity price. At a Nash equilibrium, each PEV reacts optimally with respect to a commonly observed charging trajectory that is the average of all PEV strategies. This average is given by the solution of a fixed point problem in the limit of infinite population size. The ideal solution minimizes electricity generation costs by scheduling PEV demand to fill the overnight non-PEV demand "valley". The paper's central theoretical result is a proof of the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium that almost satisfies that ideal. This result is accompanied by a decentralized computational algorithm and a proof that the algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium in the infinite system limit. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the solution strategy for finite populations. The examples demonstrate that convergence to the Nash equilibrium occurs very quickly over a broad range of parameters, and suggest this method could be useful in situations where frequent communication with PEVs is not possible. The method is useful in applications where fully centralized control is not possible, but where optimal or near-optimal charging patterns are essential to system operation.},

Thus far, studies of the CDF model and its connection to the other relaxations have been limited to power distribution systems, which omit several parameters necessary for modeling transmission systems. To increase the applicability of the CDF relaxation, this paper develops an extended CDF model that is suitable for transmission systems by incorporating bus shunts, line charging, and transformers. Additionally, a theoretical result shows that the established equivalence of the SOC and CDF models for distribution systems also holds in this transmission system extension.},

When the relaxation in each node of a branch-and- bound tree is solved by column generation, one speaks of branch-and-price. Optionally, cutting planes can be added in order to strengthen the relaxation, and this is called branch- price-and-cut. We introduce the common concepts of convexification and discretization to arrive at a Dantzig-Wolfe type reformulation of a mixed integer program. The relation between the original and the extended formulations helps us understand how cutting planes should be formulated and how branching decisions can be taken while keeping the column generation subproblems manageable.},

abstract = {Storage is being proposed to solve many issues on the electric power grid, especially those issues related to renewable generation such as wind and solar generation. Some North American state and provincial regulators are requiring large amounts of storage to be installed to support anticipated needs of the power grid. Much of that new storage is expected to be connected to distribution feeders. Distribution planners lack tools and methods to assess storage impact on distribution system capacity, reliability, and power quality. Planners are accustomed to static power flow calculations, but accurate analysis of storage requires sequential-time simulation. This paper describes modeling storage for various types of simulations on distribution systems for different time frames typically involved. The basic impact on capacity and voltage regulation can generally be evaluated in simulations with 15-min to 1-h intervals. Evaluations of smoothing of renewable generation variations may require simulations with time step sizes of 1 min or less. Evaluations of such things as frequency control of microgrids and performance during transient disturbances will require dynamics analysis in intervals ranging from seconds down to microseconds. This paper is a summary of recent Electric Power Research Institute research in modeling energy storage for planning studies. {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

Based on 1), a modified OPF problem is proposed, whose corresponding SOCP is guaranteed to be exact. We also prove that SOCP has at most one optimal solution if it is exact.

The basic idea of such methods is that a random sample is generated and the expected value function is approximated by the corresponding sample average function. The obtained sample average optimization problem is solved, and the procedure is repeated several times until a stopping criterion is satisfied. We discuss convergence rates, stopping rules, and computational complexity of this procedure and present a numerical example for the stochastic knapsack problem},

@article{Louca2013a,
abstract = {The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is non-convex and, for generic network structures, is NP-hard. A recent flurry of work has explored the use of semidefinite relaxations to solve the OPF problem. For general network structures, however, this approach may fail to yield solutions that are physically meaningful, in the sense that they are high rank - precluding their efficient mapping back to the original feasible set. In certain cases, however, there may exist a hidden rank-one optimal solution. In this paper an iterative linearization-minimization algorithm is proposed to uncover rank-one solutions for the relaxation. The iterates are shown to converge to a stationary point. A simple bisection method is also proposed to address problems for which the linearization-minimization procedure fails to yield a rank-one optimal solution. The algorithms are tested on representative power system examples. In many cases, the linearization-minimization procedure obtains a rank-one optimal solution where the naive semidefinite relaxation fails. Furthermore, a 14-bus example is provided for which the linearization-minimization algorithm achieves a rank-one solution with a cost strictly lower than that obtained by a conventional solver. We close by discussing some rank monotonicity properties of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Borraz-Sanchez2016,
abstract = {Within the energy sector, two of the most tightly coupled systems are natural gas and electric power. The recent advent of cheap gas extraction technologies have only driven these systems more tightly together. Despite their interconnections, in many areas of the world these systems are operated and managed in isolation. This separation is due to a number of reasons and challenges, ranging from technological (problems involving connected systems are difficult to solve) to political and commercial (prevention of monopolies, lack of communication, market forces, etc.). However, this separation can lead to a number of undesirable outcomes, such as what the northeastern United States experienced during the winter of 2013/2014. In this paper, we develop approaches to address the technological reasons for separation. We consider the problem of expanding and designing coupled natural gas and electric power systems to meet increased coincident demand on both systems. Our approach utilizes recent advances in convex modeling of gas and power systems to develop a computationally tractable optimization formulation.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of finding a low-rank solution of an arbitrary sparse linear matrix inequality (LMI). To this end, we map the sparsity of the LMI problem into a graph. We develop a theory relating the rank of the minimum-rank solution of the LMI problem to the sparsity of its underlying graph. Furthermore, we propose two graph-theoretic convex programs to obtain a low-rank solution. The first convex optimization needs a tree decomposition of the sparsity graph, which is an NP-hard problem in the worst case. The second one does not rely on any computationally expensive graph analysis and is always polynomial-time solvable. The results of this work can be readily applied to three separate problems of minimum-rank matrix completion, conic relaxation for polynomial optimization, and affine rank minimization. The results are finally illustrated on two applications of optimal distributed control and nonlinear optimization for electrical networks.},

@article{Bent2012,
abstract = {In recent years, the transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) problem has become increasingly complex. As this problem is a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, researchers have traditionally focused on approximate models of power flows to solve the TNEP problem. Until recently, these approximations have produced results that are straightforward to adapt to the more complex problem. However, the power grid is evolving towards a state where the adaptations are no longer as easy (e.g., large amounts of limited control, renewable genera- tion), necessitating new approaches. In this paper, we propose a discrepancy-bounded local search (DBLS) that encapsulates the complexity of power flow modeling in a black box that may be queried for information about the quality of a proposed expansion. This allows the development of an optimization algorithm that is decoupled from the details of the underlying power model. Case studies are presented to demonstrate cost differences in plans developed under different power flow models.},

abstract = {We study stochastic programs where the decision-maker cannot observe the distribution of the exogenous uncertainties but has access to a finite set of independent samples from this distribution. In this setting, the goal is to find a procedure that transforms the data to an estimate of the expected cost function under the unknown data-generating distribution, i.e., a predictor, and an optimizer of the estimated cost function that serves as a near-optimal candidate decision, i.e., a prescriptor. As functions of the data, predictors and prescriptors constitute statistical estimators. We propose a meta-optimization problem to find the least conservative predictors and prescriptors subject to constraints on their out-of-sample disappointment. The out-of-sample disappointment quantifies the probability that the actual expected cost of the candidate decision under the unknown true distribution exceeds its predicted cost. Leveraging tools from large deviations theory, we prove that this meta-optimization problem admits a unique solution: The best predictor-prescriptor pair is obtained by solving a distributionally robust optimization problem over all distributions within a given relative entropy distance from the empirical distribution of the data.},

In this manuscript we focus on two questions: (1) how can researchers empirically verify theoretical advances and consistently compare methods in production software settings and (2) how can users (scientific domain experts) keep up with the state-of-the-art methods to select those which are most appropriate? Here we describe how the confederated modular API of DifferentialEquations.jl addresses these concerns. We detail the package-free API which allows numerical methods researchers to readily utilize and benchmark any compatible method directly in full-scale scientific applications. In addition, we describe how the complexity of the method choices is abstracted via a polyalgorithm. We show how scientific tooling built on top of DifferentialEquations.jl, such as packages for dynamical systems quantification and quantum optics simulation, both benefit from this structure and provide themselves as convenient benchmarking tools.},

This paper focuses on the mod- eling and solution approach of AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) for unbalanced distribution systems with DERs and voltage reg- ulation transformers (VRT). The ACOPF problem is formulated as a chordal relaxation based semidefinite programming (SDP) model, and a tighter convexification model of VRTs is proposed for mitigating solution inexactness. Analytical conditions are pre- sented and proved to determine whether global optimal solution to the original ACOPF problem can be retrieved from solutions of the chordal relaxation based SDP model. Numerical studies on modified IEEE 34-bus and 8500-node systems show that the pro- posed approach presents a better computational performance as compared to rank relaxation based SDP approaches and general nonlinear solvers.},

abstract = {We study power control in optimization and game frameworks. In the optimization framework there is a single decision maker who assigns network resources and in the game framework users share the network resources according to Nash equilibrium. The solution of these problems is based on so-called water-filling technique, which in turn uses bisection method for solution of non-linear equations for Lagrange multipliers. Here we provide a closed form solution to the water-filling problem, which allows us to solve it in a finite number of operations. Also, we produce a closed form solution for the Nash equilibrium in symmetric Gaussian interference game with an arbitrary number of users. Even though the game is symmetric, there is an intrinsic hierarchical structure induced by the quantity of the resources available to the users. We use this hierarchical structure to perform a successive reduction of the game. In addition to its mathematical beauty, the explicit solution allows one to study limiting cases when the crosstalk coefficient is either small or large. We provide an alternative simple proof of the convergence of the Iterative Water Filling Algorithm. Furthermore, it turns out that the convergence of Iterative Water Filling Algorithm slows down when the crosstalk coefficient is large. Using the closed form solution, we can avoid this problem. Finally, we compare the non-cooperative approach with the cooperative approach and show that the non-cooperative approach results in a more fair resource distribution.},

The exchange of GDP for GTP on Arf is catalyzed by a family of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) containing a Sec7 domain. The Sec7 domain is a target of brefeldin A, which inhibits various trafficking processes and induces organelle disintegration. During the past few years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the structure and catalytic mechanism of the Sec7 domains and physiological functions of the Sec7 domain-containing Arf-GEFs. Here we review the structures and functions of Arf-GEFs by focusing on the regulation of membrane traffic.},

abstract = {Nonlinear convex relaxations of the power flow equations and, in particular, the Semi-Definite Programming (SDP), Convex Quadratic (QC), and Second-Order Cone (SOC) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent years. Thus far, little attention has been given to simpler linear relaxations of the power flow equations, which may bring significant performance gains at the cost of model accuracy. To fill the gap, this paper develops two intuitive linear relaxations of the power flow equations, one based on classic network flow models (NF) and another inspired by copper plate approximations (CP). Theoretical results show that the proposed NF model is a relaxation of the established nonlinear SOC model and the CP model is a relaxation of the NF model. Consequently, considering the linear NF and CP relaxations alongside the established nonlinear relaxations (SDP, QC, SOC) provides a rich variety of tradeoffs between the relaxation accuracy and performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, an algorithm is developed for the estimation of voltage phasors in power systems under lowobservability conditions. Traditional state estimation techniques require full observability; however, that is not necessarily realistic, especially in distribution systems. With the amount of information about the system growing in the form of increased smart meter use, distributed generation sources, as well as other data sources, it becomes possible to use this wide variety of information to estimate the voltage phasors within a network. We propose a matrix completion approach, a tool for estimating missing values in low rank matrices, to accomplish this. The basic matrix completion algorithm is augmented with power-flow constraints which provide an additional link between parameter values. This improves the accuracy of estimation while requiring less data. The method is numerically evaluated using typical IEEE test systems.},

@article{Christakou2015,
abstract = {The optimal power-flow problem (OPF) has played a key role in the planning and operation of power systems. Due to the non-linear nature of the AC power-flow equations, the OPF problem is known to be non-convex, therefore hard to solve. Most proposed methods for solving the OPF rely on approximations that render the problem convex, but that may yield inexact solutions. Recently, Farivar and Low proposed a method that is claimed to be exact for radial distribution systems, despite no apparent approximations. In our work, we show that it is, in fact, not exact. On one hand, there is a misinterpretation of the physical network model related to the ampacity constraint of the lines' current flows. On the other hand, the proof of the exactness of the proposed relaxation requires unrealistic assumptions related to the unboundedness of specific control variables. We also show that the extension of this approach to account for exact line models might provide physically infeasible solutions. Recently, several contributions have proposed OPF algorithms that rely on the use of the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, as we show in this work, there are cases for which the ADMM-based solution of the non-relaxed OPF problem fails to converge. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose an algorithm for the solution of a non-approximated, non-convex OPF problem in radial distribution systems that is based on the method of multipliers, and on a primal decomposition of the OPF. This work is divided in two parts. In Part I, we specifically discuss the limitations of BFM and ADMM to solve the OPF problem. In Part II, we provide a centralized version and a distributed asynchronous version of the proposed OPF algorithm and we evaluate its performances using both small-scale electrical networks, as well as a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder.},

The latter bases its actions on the hourly prices set by the leader, as well as the preference schedules set by the users for each task. We consider both the monopolistic and competitive situations, and validate numerically the potential of this approach to achieve an 'optimal' trade-off between three conflicting objectives: revenue, user cost and peak demand.},

abstract = {We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause continued warming on a "Hothouse Earth" pathway even as human emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System-biosphere, climate, and societies-and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

abstract = {DC power flow approximations are ubiquitous in the electricity industry. However, these linear approximations fail to capture important physical aspects of power flow, such as the reactive power and voltage magnitude, which are crucial in many applications to ensure voltage stability and AC solution feasibility. This paper proposes two LP approximations of the AC optimal power flow problem, founded on tight polyhedral approximations of the SOC constraints, in the aim of retaining the good lower bounds of the SOCP relaxation and relishing the computational efficiency of LP solvers. The high accuracy of the two LP approximations is corroborated by rigorous computational evaluations on systems with up to 9241 buses and different operating conditions. The computational efficiency of the two proposed LP models is shown to be comparable to, if not better than, that of the SOCP models in most instances. This performance is ideal for MILP extensions of these LP models since MILP is computationally more efficient than MIQCP.},

abstract = {Nonconvexity induced by the nonlinear AC power flow equations challenges solution algorithms for AC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. While significant research efforts have focused on reliably computing high-quality OPF solutions, identifying a feasible path from an initial operating to a desired operating point is a topic that has received much less attention. However, since the feasible space of the OPF problem is nonconvex and potentially disconnected, it can be challenging to transition between operating points while avoiding constraint violations. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm which computes a provably feasible path from an initial operating point to a desired operating point. The algorithm solves a sequence of quadratic optimization problems over conservative convex inner approximations of the OPF feasible space, each representing a so-called convex restriction. In each iteration, we obtain a new, improved operating point and a feasible transition from the operating point in the previous iteration. In addition to computing a feasible path to a known desired operating point, this algorithm can also be used to locally improve the operating point. Extensive numerical studies on a variety of test cases demonstrate the algorithm and the ability to arrive at a high-quality solution in few iterations.},

abstract = {We call "on/off" constraint an algebraic constraint that is activated if and only if a corresponding boolean variable equals 1. Our main subject of interest is to derive tight convex formulations of Mixed Integer NonLinear Programs featuring "on/off" constraints. We study the simple set defined by one "on/off" constraint with bounded variables. Using Disjunctive Programming, we introduce convex hull formulations of this set defined in higher dimensional spaces. Because the large number of variables in these formulations appears to be practically disadvantageous, we concentrate our efforts on defining explicit projections into lower dimensional spaces. Based on these results, we present new formulations to a well-known telecommunication problem: routing several commodities subject to multiple delay constraints. Numerical results are presented to assess the efficiency of the new models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present a general methodology to study the electricity market of a country or region, under various pricing mechanisms. The approach is based on modifications of a large-scale techno-economic model, and is applied to a realistic model for the Province of Quebec. Mathematical programming and a new decomposition procedure are used to simulate different electricity pricing schemes and their effects on the producer's and consumer's decisions. Three types of pricing are analyzed, each one corresponding to a different equilibrium: marginal cost pricing, leading to a pure competition equilibrium, an affine function of the marginal cost, leading to a regulated equilibrium, and monopolistic pricing, chosen by the producer to minimize its costs while knowing the optimal consumers' reaction to the proposed price of electricity (Stackelberg-type equilibrium). The three equilibria are described and justified, and a large-scale application to the province of Quebec is presented and discussed in some detail.},

abstract = {The use and development of mobile interventions is experiencing rapid growth. In "just-in-time" mobile interventions, treatments are provided via a mobile device that are intended to help an individual make healthy decisions" in the moment," and thus have a proximal, near future impact. Currently the development of mobile interventions is proceeding at a much faster pace than that of associated data science methods. A first step toward developing data-based methods is to provide an experimental design for use in testing the proximal effects of these just-in-time treatments. In this paper, we propose a "micro-randomized" trial design for this purpose. In a micro-randomized trial, treatments are sequentially randomized throughout the conduct of the study, with the result that each participant may be randomized at the 100s or 1000s of occasions at which a treatment might be provided. Further, we develop a test statistic for assessing the proximal effect of a treatment as well as an associated sample size calculator. We conduct simulation evaluations of the sample size calculator in various settings. Rules of thumb that might be used in designing the micro-randomized trial are discussed. This work is motivated by our collaboration on the HeartSteps mobile application designed to increase physical activity.},

abstract = {The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm for provably computing the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to eliminate the consideration of discretization points for which the power flow equations are provably infeasible. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.},

In the literature, such projects are deprecated since they might cause bottlenecks in development and communication. However, there is little empirical evidence on this matter. Further, recent studies show that such hero projects are very prevalent. Accordingly, this paper explores the effect of having heroes in project, from a code quality perspective. We identify the heroes developer communities in 1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis, we find that (a) hero projects are majorly all projects; and (b) the commits from "hero developers" (who contribute most to the code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers. That is, contrary to the literature, heroes are standard and very useful part of modern open source projects.},

We show that the admittance matrix can be uniquely identified from a sequence of measurements of different steady states when the system is fully observable, and a reduced admittance matrix (from Kron reduction) can be determined when the system is not fully observable (i.e., it contains some hidden nodes). Furthermore, we propose efficient algorithms based on graph theory and optimization to uncover the original admittance matrix of radial and mesh systems with hidden nodes. As a case study, we explore the application of the proposed algorithms to detect and locate faults and other critical events. Simulations performed on a standard test system confirm that these algorithms provide accurate estimates of the admittance matrix even when the measurements are perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise.},

abstract = {We show how an adaptive control algorithm can improve the performance of distributed reactive power control in a radial distribution circuit with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) cells. The adaptive algorithm is designed to balance the need for power quality (voltage regulation) with the desire to minimize power loss. The adaptation law determines whether the objective function minimizes power losses or voltage regulation based on whether the voltage at each node remains close enough to the voltage at the substation. The reactive power is controlled through the inverter on the PV cells. The control signals are determined based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive power at each node. We use the example of a single branch radial distribution circuit to demonstrate the ability of the adaptive scheme to effectively reduce voltage variations while simultaneously minimizing the power loss in the studied cases. Simulations verify that the adaptive schemes compares favorably with local and global schemes previously reported in the literature.},

abstract = {Advanced distribution management system (DMS), an evolution of supervisory control and data acquisition obtained by extending its working principles from transmission to distribution, is the brain of a smart grid. Advanced DMS assesses smart functions in the distribution system and is also responsible for assessing control functions such as reactive dispatch, voltage regulation, contingency analysis, capability maximization, or line switching. Optimal power flow (OPF)-based tools can be suitably adapted to the requirements of smart distribution network and be employed in an advanced DMS framework. In this paper, the authors present a methodology for unbalanced three-phase OPF (TOPF) for DMS in a smart grid. In the formulation of the TOPF, control variables of the optimization problem are actual active load demand and reactive power outputs of microgenerators. The TOPF is based on a quasi-Newton method and makes use of an open-source three-phase unbalanced distribution load flow. Test results are presented on the IEEE 123-bus Radial Distribution Feeder test case.},

abstract = {In recent years the power systems research community has seen an explosion of work applying operations research techniques to challenging power network optimization problems. Regardless of the application under consideration, all of these works rely on power system test cases for evaluation and validation. However, many of the well established power system test cases were developed as far back as the 1960s with the aim of testing AC power flow algorithms. It is unclear if these power flow test cases are suitable for power system optimization studies. This report surveys all of the publicly available AC transmission system test cases, to the best of our knowledge, and assess their suitability for optimization tasks. It finds that many of the traditional test cases are missing key network operation constraints, such as line thermal limits and generator capability curves. To incorporate these missing constraints, data driven models are developed from a variety of publicly available data sources. The resulting extended test cases form a compressive archive, NESTA, for the evaluation and validation of power system optimization algorithms.},

@article{Pajic2007,
abstract = {The research conducted in this dissertation is divided into two main parts. The first part provides further improvements in power system state estimation and the second part implements Contingency Constrained Optimal Power Flow (CCOPF) in a stochastic multiple contingency framework. As a real-time application in modern power systems, the existing Newton-QR state estimation algorithms are too slow and too fragile numerically. This dissertation presents a new and more robust method that is based on trust region techniques. A faster method was found among the class of Krylov subspace iterative methods, a robust implementation of the conjugate gradient method, called the LSQR method. Both algorithms have been tested against the widely used Newton-QR state estimator on the standard IEEE test networks. The trust region method-based state estimator was found to be very reliable under severe conditions (bad data, topological and parameter errors). This enhanced reliability justifies the additional time and computational effort required for its execution. The numerical simulations indicate that the iterative Newton-LSQR method is competitive in robustness with classical direct Newton-QR. The gain in computational efficiency has not come at the cost of solution reliability. The second part of the dissertation combines Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)-based CCOPF with Monte Carlo importance sampling to estimate the operating cost of multiple contingencies. We also developed an LP-based formulation for the CCOPF that can efficiently calculate Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) under multiple contingencies. Based on Monte Carlo importance sampling idea, the proposed algorithm can stochastically assess the impact of multiple contingencies on LMP-congestion prices.},

Why would a statistician working on factor analysis raise open problems about determinantal varieties? Connections of this type are at the heart of the new field of "algebraic statistics". In this field, mathematicians and statisticians come together to solve statistical inference problems using concepts from algebraic geometry as well as related computational and combinatorial techniques. The goal of these lectures is to introduce newcomers from the different camps to algebraic statistics. The introduction will be centered around the following three observations: many important statistical models correspond to algebraic or semi-algebraic sets of parameters; the geometry of these parameter spaces determines the behaviour of widely used statistical inference procedures; computational algebraic geometry can be used to study parameter spaces and other features of statistical models.},

abstract = {Decision analysis produces measures of value such as expected net present values or expected utilities and ranks alternatives by these value estimates. Other optimization-based processes operate in a similar manner. With uncertainty and limited resources, an analysis is never perfect, so these value estimates are subject to error. We show that if we take these value estimates at face value and select accordingly, we should expect the value of the chosen alternative to be less than its estimate, even if the value estimates are unbiased. Thus, when comparing actual outcomes to value estimates, we should expect to be disappointed on average, not because of any inherent bias in the estimates themselves, but because of the optimization-based selection process. We call this phenomenon the optimizer's curse and argue that it is not well understood or appreciated in the decision analysis and management science communities. This curse may be a factor in creating skepticism in decision makers who review the results of an analysis. In this paper, we study the optimizer's curse and show that the resulting expected disappointment may be substantial. We then propose the use of Bayesian methods to adjust value estimates. These Bayesian methods can be viewed as disciplined skepticism and provide a method for avoiding this postdecision disappointment.},

abstract = {We propose a method to solve online mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problems at very high speed using machine learning. By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we are able to greatly speedup the solution time. Our approach encodes the optimal solution into a small amount of information denoted as strategy using the Voice of Optimization framework proposed in [BS18]. In this way the core part of the optimization algorithm becomes a multiclass classification problem which can be solved very quickly. In this work we extend that framework to real-time and high-speed applications focusing on parametric mixed-integer quadratic optimization (MIQO). We propose an extremely fast online optimization algorithm consisting of a feedforward neural network (NN) evaluation and a linear system solution where the matrix has already been factorized. Therefore, this online approach does not require any solver nor iterative algorithm. We show the speed of the proposed method both in terms of total computations required and measured execution time. We estimate the number of floating point operations (flops) required to completely recover the optimal solution as a function of the problem dimensions. Compared to state-of-the-art MIO routines, the online running time of our method is very predictable and can be lower than a single matrix factorization time. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi obtaining from two to three orders of magnitude speedups on benchmarks with real-world data.},

The hallmark of matheuristics is the central role played by the mathematical programming model, around which the overall heuristic is built. As such, matheuristic is not a rigid paradigm but rather a concept framework for the design of mathematically sound heuristics. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the main matheuristic ideas. Three specific applications in the field of wind farm, packing, and vehicle routing optimization, respectively, are addressed and used to illustrate the main features of the method.},

Without this, the risk is that current policy produces a healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and re-structured) in a deeply sick economy, which continues to reward value extraction over value creation activities.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

First, an outline of the IEC calculation methodology is presented, including all relevant equations for DG cases studies. Then the short-circuit contribution of the various DG types is extensively discussed. The application of the methodology is demonstrated on a study case medium voltage distribution network, which includes all representative types of DG sources. Emphasis is placed on the contribution of the upstream system, which is the dominant source of short-circuit current. A discussion is also included on potential measures for fault level reduction. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Immediately following a contingency, the injections of storage units are adjusted almost instantly to alleviate short-term emergency overloads, thereby avoiding potential cascading outages and giving slow ramping generating units time to adjust their output. The ESCUC is a large two-stage mixed-integer programming problem. A Benders decomposition has been developed to solve this problem. In order to achieve computational tractability, we present several acceleration techniques to improve the convergence of the proposed algorithm.

Detailed component models are needed for all system components in the simulation. Utilizing the phase frame representation for all network elements, a program called Generalized Distribution Analysis Systems, with a number of features and capabilities not found in existing packages, has been developed for large-scale distribution system simulations. The system being analyzed can be balanced or unbalanced and can be a radial, network, or mixed-type distribution system. Furthermore, because the individual phase representation is employed for both system and component models, the system can comprise single, double, and three-phase systems simultaneously},

abstract = {An application of bilevel programming in the electric utility industry is presented. The model is nonlinear and is used to analyze various economic issues that affect electric utility planning. The electric utility at the upper level of the model seeks to minimize costs or maximize benefits while controlling electric rates and subsidizing energy conservation programs. Customers at the lower level attempt to maximize their net benefit by consuming electricity and investing in conservation. This model considers factors such as free riders and the rebound effect which affect the net benefits of utility resource plans but are ignored by most planning models. The model's solutions shed light on utility issues including whether there can be a practical difference between various objectives, including minimizing cost ("least cost" planning) and maximizing net social welfare ("value based" planning). {\textcopyright} 1992 J.C.

abstract = {As the modern transmission control and relay technologies evolve, transmission line switching has become an important option in power system operators' toolkits to reduce operational cost and improve system reliability. Most recent research has relied on the DC approximation of the power flow model in the optimal transmission switching problem. However, it is known that DC approximation may lead to inaccurate flow solutions and also overlook stability issues. In this paper, we focus on the optimal transmission switching problem with the full AC power flow model, abbreviated as AC OTS. We propose a new exact formulation for AC OTS and its mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) relaxation. We improve this relaxation via several types of strong valid inequalities inspired by the recent development for the closely related AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) problem. We also propose a practical algorithm to obtain high quality feasible solutions for the AC OTS problem. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed formulation and algorithms efficiently solve IEEE standard and congested instances and lead to significant cost benefits with provably tight bounds.},

abstract = {This paper presents three new contributions to power flow analysis of unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. First, a complex vector based model in $\alpha$$\beta$0 stationary reference frame is developed to state the power flow equations using a compact matrix formulation. The proposed model is based on Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Then, a general and exact power transformer model in the $\alpha$$\beta$0 reference frame is proposed. Finally, this transformer model is incorporated into the power flow problem. It will be shown that the use of an orthogonal reference frame simplifies the modeling of the distribution network components. In this work, both the network and the power transformer, as well as PQ type loads, PQ and PV type generators and a slack bus are modeled. By using the node incidence matrix instead of the admittance matrix, the information about the grid topology and the grid parameters (including power transformers) is separately organized. As it will be demonstrated, the proposed formulation is ready to incorporate other complex models of loads, generators or storage devices. The model is tested by using the IEEE 4-Node and the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeders with different transformer connections and balanced and unbalanced lines and loads.},

@article{Gemine2014,
abstract = {With the increasing share of renewable and distributed generation in electrical distribution systems, Active Network Management (ANM) becomes a valuable option for a distribution system operator to operate his system in a secure and cost-effective way without relying solely on network reinforcement. ANM strategies are short-term policies that control the power injected by generators and/or taken off by loads in order to avoid congestion or voltage issues. While simple ANM strategies consist in curtailing temporary excess generation, more advanced strategies rather attempt to move the consumption of loads to anticipated periods of high renewable generation. However, such advanced strategies imply that the system operator has to solve large-scale optimal sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Uncertainty must be explicitly accounted for because neither demand nor generation can be accurately forecasted. We first formalize the ANM problem, which in addition to be sequential and uncertain, has a non-linear nature stemming from the power flow equations and a discrete nature arising from the activation of power modulation signals. This ANM problem is then cast as a stochastic mixed integer non-linear program, for which we provide quantitative results using state of the art open source solvers and perform a sensitivity analysis over the amount of flexibility available in the system and the number of scenarios considered in the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic program. To foster further research on this problem, we make available a test bed based on a 75-bus distribution network at http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/{\~{}}anm/ . This test bed contains a simulator of the distribution system, with stochastic models for the generation and consumption devices, and callbacks to implement and test various ANM strategies.},

Environmental and sustainability concerns lead to replacement of a signiﬁcant share of conventional fossil fuel-based power plants with renewable energy resources. This transition involves the major challenge of substituting synchronous machines and their well-known dynamics and controllers with power electronics-interfaced generation whose regulation and interaction with the rest of the system is yet to be fully understood. In this article, we review the challenges of such low-inertia power systems, and survey the solutions that have been put forward thus far. We strive to concisely summarize the laidout scientiﬁc foundations as well as the practical experiences of industrial and academic demonstration projects. We touch upon the topics of power system stability, modeling, and control, and we particularly focus on the role of frequency, inertia, as well as control of power converters and from the demand-side.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method in expansion planning of transmission systems using the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF). The AC-OPF provides a more accurate picture of power flow in the network compared to the DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) that is usually considered in the literature for transmission expansion planning (TEP). While the AC-OPF-based TEP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, this paper transforms it into a mixed-integer linear programming environment. This transformation guarantees achievement of a global optimal solution by the existing algorithms and software. The proposed model has been successfully applied to a simple 3-bus power system, Garver's 6-bus test system, 24-bus IEEE reliability test system (RTS) as well as a realistic power system. Detailed case studies are presented and thoroughly analyzed. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method on the TEP. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Roux2018,
abstract = {Semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers are increasingly used as primitives in many program verification tasks to synthesize and verify polynomial invariants for a variety of systems including programs, hybrid systems and stochastic models. On one hand, they provide a tractable alternative to reasoning about semi-algebraic constraints. However, the results are often unreliable due to "numerical issues" that include a large number of reasons such as floating-point errors, ill-conditioned problems, failure of strict feasibility, and more generally, the specifics of the algorithms used to solve SDPs. These issues influence whether the final numerical results are trustworthy or not. In this paper, we briefly survey the emerging use of SDP solvers in the static analysis community. We report on the perils of using SDP solvers for common invariant synthesis tasks, characterizing the common failures that can lead to unreliable answers. Next, we demonstrate existing tools for guaranteed semidefinite programming that often prove inadequate to our needs. Finally, we present a solution for verified semidefinite programming that can be used to check the reliability of the solution output by the solver and a padding procedure that can check the presence of a feasible nearby solution to the one output by the solver. We report on some successful preliminary experiments involving our padding procedure.},

Their computation efficiency overcomes the small imprecision caused by the modeling simplifications and assumptions made in both transmission and distributions simulation packages. However, the interest for modeling more accurately unbalanced multiphase networks and solving complex integrated transmission-distribution systems has greatly increased among the power system specialists. The present work develops an unbalanced multiphase load-flow algorithm with the capability to model all components and network features found in power systems. The proposed algorithm allows the use of any existing positive-sequence load-flow solver as the main engine. The simulation results validated with EMTP-RV and CYMDIST prove that the proposed methodology has good numerical accuracy, robustness and efficiency},

abstract = {The matrix rank minimization problem consists of finding a matrix of minimum rank that satisfies given convex constraints. It is NP-hard in general and has applications in control, system identification, and machine learning. Reweighted trace minimization has been considered as an iterative heuristic for this problem. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of this iterative heuristic, showing that the difference between successive iterates tends to zero. Then, after reformulating the heuristic as reweighted nuclear norm minimization, we propose an efficient gradient-based implementation that takes advantage of the new formulation and opens the way to solving large-scale problems. We apply this algorithm to the problem of low-order system identification from input-output data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the reweighted nuclear norm minimization makes model order selection easier and results in lower order models compared to nuclear norm minimization without weights.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

That is, the spacing distances between phases are not equal and the lines are not transposed; as is typically done on high voltage transmission lines. The nonsymmetry results in unequal self and mutual impedances. Couple this with line currents that are typically unbalanced and a potential for severe voltage unbalances can occur along with additional line power losses. For a four wire grounded wye line, the unbalanced operation leads to currents flowing in the neutral and dirt (ground). This paper will develop a method for the computation of the neutral and dirt currents and the power losses that are a result of these currents.},

abstract = {We consider stochastic programs where the distribution of the uncertain parameters is only observable through a finite training dataset. Using the Wasserstein metric, we construct a ball in the space of (multivariate and non-discrete) probability distributions centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples, and we seek decisions that perform best in view of the worst-case distribution within this Wasserstein ball. The state-of-the-art methods for solving the resulting distributionally robust optimization problems rely on global optimization techniques, which quickly become computationally excruciating. In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the distributionally robust optimization problems over Wasserstein balls can in fact be reformulated as finite convex programs---in many interesting cases even as tractable linear programs. Leveraging recent measure concentration results, we also show that their solutions enjoy powerful finite-sample performance guarantees. Our theoretical results are exemplified in mean-risk portfolio optimization as well as uncertainty quantification.},

@article{Molzahn2015,
abstract = {Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. We use the example OPF problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related "mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming" hierarchy.},

@article{Tasseff,
abstract = {The advent of efficient interior point optimization methods has enabled the tractable solution of large-scale linear and nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. A prominent example of such a method is seen in Ipopt, a widely-used, open-source nonlinear optimization solver. Algorithmically, Ipopt depends on the use of a sparse symmetric indefinite linear system solver, which is heavily employed within the optimization of barrier subproblems. As such, the performance and reliability of Ipopt is critically dependent on the selection and properties of the linear solver. Inspired by a trend in mathematical programming toward solving larger and more challenging NLPs, this work explores two core questions: first, how does the scalability of available linear solvers, many of which exhibit shared-memory parallelism, impact Ipopt performance; and second , does the best linear solver vary across NLP problem class, including nonlinear network problems and problems constrained by partial differential equations? To better understand these properties, this paper first describes available open-and closed-source, serial and parallel linear solvers and the fundamental differences among them. Second, it introduces the coupling of a new open-source linear solver capable of heterogeneous par-allelism over multi-core central processing units and graphics processing units. Third, it compares linear solvers using a variety of mathematical programming problems, including standard test problems for linear and nonlinear optimization, optimal power flow benchmarks, and scal-able two-and three-dimensional partial differential equation and optimal control problems. Finally, linear solver recommendations are provided to maximize Ipopt performance across different application domains.},

At each step the algorithm alternates between solving a quasi-definite linear system with a constant coefficient matrix and a projection onto convex sets. The solver is able to exploit chordal sparsity in the problem data and to detect infeasible problems. The low per-iteration computational cost makes the method particularly efficient for large problems, e.g. semidefinite programs in portfolio optimisation, graph theory, and robust control. Our Julia implementation is open-source, extensible, integrated into the Julia optimisation ecosystem and performs well on a variety of large convex problem classes.},

This variant is achieved as a modified surrogate dual of a Lagrangian subproblem to the RLT. Special structures can be exploited to obtain reductions in problem size, without forfeiting strength.

@article{Bienstock2014a,
abstract = {When uncontrollable resources fluctuate, Optimum Power Flow (OPF), routinely used by the electric power industry to redispatch hourly controllable generation (coal, gas and hydro plants) over control areas of transmission networks, can result in grid instability, and, potentially, cascading outages. This risk arises because OPF dispatch is computed without awareness of major uncertainty, in particular fluctuations in renewable output. As a result, grid operation under the OPF with renewable variability can lead to frequent conditions where power line flow ratings are significantly exceeded. Such a condition, which is borne by simulations of real grids, would likely resulting in automatic line tripping to protect lines from thermal stress, a risky and undesirable outcome which compromises stability. Smart grid goals include a commitment to large penetration of highly fluctuating renewables, thus calling to reconsider current practices, in particular the use of standard OPF. Our Chance Constrained (CC) OPF corrects the problem and mitigates dangerous renewable fluctuations with minimal changes in the current operational procedure. Assuming availability of a reliable wind forecast parameterizing the distribution function of the uncertain generation, our CCOPF satisfies all the constraints with high probability while simultaneously minimizing the cost of economic redispatch. CCOPF allows efficient implementation, e.g. solving a typical instance over the 2746bus Polish network in 20s on a standard laptop},

@article{MacKay2013,
abstract = {Taking the UK as a case study, this paper describes current energy use and a range of sustainable energy options for the future, including solar power and other renewables. I focus on the area involved in collecting, converting and delivering sustainable energy, looking in particular detail at the potential role of solar power. Britain consumes energy at a rate of about 5000 watts per person, and its population density is about 250 people per square kilometre. If we multiply the per capita energy consumption by the population density, then we obtain the average primary energy consumption per unit area, which for the UK is 1.25 watts per square metre. This areal power density is uncomfortably similar to the average power density that could be supplied by many renewables: the gravitational potential energy of rainfall in the Scottish highlands has a raw power per unit area of roughly 0.24 watts per square metre; energy crops in Europe deliver about 0.5 watts per square metre; wind farms deliver roughly 2.5 watts per square metre; solar photovoltaic farms in Bavaria, Germany, and Vermont, USA, deliver 4 watts per square metre; in sunnier locations, solar photovoltaic farms can deliver 10 watts per square metre; concentrating solar power stations in deserts might deliver 20 watts per square metre. In a decarbonized world that is renewable-powered, the land area required to maintain today's British energy consumption would have to be similar to the area of Britain. Several other high-density, high-consuming countries are in the same boat as Britain, and many other countries are rushing to join us. Decarbonizing such countries will only be possible through some combination of the following options: the embracing of country-sized renewable power-generation facilities; large-scale energy imports from country-sized renewable facilities in other countries; population reduction; radical efficiency improvements and lifestyle changes; and the growth of non-renewable low-carbon sources, namely 'clean' coal, 'clean' gas and nuclear power. If solar is to play a large role in the future energy system, then we need new methods for energy storage; very-large-scale solar either would need to be combined with electricity stores or it would need to serve a large flexible demand for energy that effectively stores useful energy in the form of chemicals, heat, or cold.},

abstract = {A battery energy storage system (BESS) for a utility scale photovoltaic (PV) power plant is proposed. PV systems suffer from intermittency and partial shading problems, which could lead to power fluctuations and reduce grid stability. Utilities' inability to service the contracted load might lead to hefty penalties by the regulators. To reduce the effects of intermittency on PV output, a utility scale BESS is proposed for a multilevel inverter with medium frequency transformer link. This also enables PV plants to participate in short-term energy markets. The BESS power is rated at 10{\%} of the PV plant rating. The battery is interfaced to the PV system dc bus through a bidirectional 3-level boost-buck dc-dc converter, which is controlled to regulate power flow. Analysis shows that a 10{\%} BESS rating is capable of providing real power support to mitigate insolation intermittencies by 80{\%}. The operation for battery charging and discharging modes are discussed in this paper. A design example for a 125 kW BESS is provided and simulation results validate grid support capability. Experimental results from a scaled-down laboratory prototype are also presented in this paper.},

@article{Gimeno-Gutierrez2015,
abstract = {Flexible electricity systems allow a higher penetration of variable renewable energy, and flexibility can be achieved through pumped hydropower storage (PHS). This assessment of European PHS potential focuses on linking two existing reservoirs to form a PHS system, the reservoirs must have adequate difference in elevation (head) and be close enough so that they can be reasonably linked. The results show that the theoretical potential energy storage is significant as it reaches 54TWh when a maximum distance of 20km between the existing reservoirs is considered. When constraints are applied, e.g. discounting populated areas, protected natural areas or transport infrastructure, the so-called maximum realisable potential is halved to 29TWh. Comparing with the existing PHS storage capacity reported for 14 countries suggests that the theoretical potential is 3.5 times the existing capacity, whereas the realisable potential is still twice the existing capacity.},

abstract = {This work introduces a statistical classifier that quickly locates line outages in a power system utilizing only time series phasor measurement data sampled during the system's transient response to the outage. The presented classifier is a linear multinomial regression model that is trained by solving a maximum likelihood optimization problem using synthetic data. The synthetic data is produced through dynamic simulations which are initialized by random samples of a forecast load/generation distribution. Real time computation of the proposed classifier is minimal and therefore the classifier is capable of locating a line outage before steady state is reached, allowing for quick corrective action in response to an outage. In addition, the output of the classifier fits into a statistical framework that is easily accessible. Specific line outages are identified as being difficult to localize and future improvements to the classifier are proposed.},

abstract = {Many optimization problems in power transmission networks can be formulated as polynomial problems with complex variables. A polynomial optimization problem with complex variables consists in optimizing a real-valued polynomial whose variables and coefficients are complex numbers subject to some complex polynomial equality or inequality constraints. These problems are usually directly converted to real variables, either using the polar form or the rectangular form. In this work, we propose a Julia module allowing the representation of polynomial problems in their original complex formulation. This module is applied to power systems optimization and its generic design enables the description of several variants of power system problems. Results for the Optimal Power Flow in Alternating Current problem and for the Preventive-Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow problem are presented.},

@book{Gonzalez-Longatt2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2018. Load-flow analysis is an effective tool that is commonly used to capture the power system operational performance and its state at a certain point in time. Power grid operators use load-flow extensively on a daily basis to plan for day-ahead and dispatch scheduling among many other purposes. Also, it used to plan any grid expansion, alter or modernization. However, due to the deterministic nature and its applicability for only one set of operational data at a certain period, deterministic load-flow reduces the chances for predicting the uncertainty in power system. Researchers usually create a data model using probabilistic analyses techniques to produce a stochastic model that mimics the realistic system data. Combining this model with Monte Carlo methodology leads to form a probabilistic load-flow tool that is more powerful and potent to carry on many uncertainty tasks and other aspects of power system assessment. This chapter presents the DIgSILENT PowerFactory script language (DPL) implementation of a DPL script to perform probabilistic power flow (PLF) using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) to consider the variability of the stochastic variables in the power system during the assessment of the steady-state performance. The developed PLF script takes input data from an external Microsoft Excel file, and then, the DPL can carry on a probabilistic load-flow and export the results using a Microsoft Excel file. The suitability of the implemented DPL is illustrated using the classical IEEE 14 buses.},

To help demystify this art, we present a set of modeling building blocks that we call "formulettes." Each formulette consists of a short verbal description that must be expressed in terms of variables and constraints in a linear or integer linear program. These formulettes can better be discussed and analyzed in isolation from the much more complicated models they comprise. Not all models can be built from the formulettes we present. Rather, these are chosen because they are the most frequent sources of mistakes. We also present Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) format; a define-before-use formulation guide we have followed for decades to express a complete formulation.},

The phenomenon is similar to the celebrated Tonks-Girardeau regime in 1D. The Floquet band of a driven lattice develops the moat shape, i.e. a minimum along a closed contour in the Brillouin zone. Such degeneracy of the kinetic energy favors fermionic quasiparticles. The statistical transmutation is achieved by the Chern-Simons flux attachment similar to the fractional quantum Hall case. We show that the velocity distribution of the released bosons is a sensitive probe of the fermionic nature of their stationary Floquet state.},

abstract = {In interconnected power systems, operated by several system operators, the participating areas are strongly dependent on their neighbors. In order to identify the economically efficient generation dispatch in each area, a distributed multi-area optimal power flow (OPF) must be solved. Additionally, installation of an increasing number of HVDC lines to deal with increased power flows from renewable generation is expected to change the power system operation paradigm. The controllability introduced by the HVDC lines should be considered and incorporated in the OPF algorithm. In this paper we introduce a formulation for the distributed solution of the OPF problem in multi-area systems consisting of both HVAC and HVDC lines. We show the applicability of this formulation on two different operating schemes for HVDC grids and we compare their performance with a central solution for the mixed HVAC/HVDC grid. The proposed formulations are based on a linearized solution of the OPF problem. The only data to be exchanged between the areas pertains to the border nodes.},
