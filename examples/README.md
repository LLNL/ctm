##  CTM JSON Schema Examples

This folder contains examples of usage of the CTM JSON Schemas. Examples are organized in two
folders for clarity:

* `instances`: contains JSON files that will validate against the CTM JSON Schemas for various use 
               cases.
* `scripts`: constains scripts that use CTM JSON Schemas, or their derived (code-generated) classes,
             to run use cases in power systems.
